\Xten{} is a modern object-oriented language designed for productivity and
performance in concurrent and distributed systems.  In this setting, dependent
types offer significant opportunities for detecting design errors statically,
documenting design decisions, eliminating costly run-time checks (e.g., for
array bounds, null values), and improving the quality of generated code.

We present the design and implementation of {\em constrained types}, a natural,
simple, clean, and expressive extension to object-oriented programming: A type
\xcd{C\{c\}} names a class or interface \xcd{C} and a {\em constraint} \xcd{c}
on the immutable state of \xcd{C} and in-scope final variables.  Constraints
may also be associated with class definitions (representing class invariants)
and with method and constructor definitions (representing preconditions).
Dynamic casting is permitted.  The system is parametric on the underlying
constraint system: the compiler supports a simple equality-based constraint
system but, in addition, supports extension with new constraint systems using
compiler plugins.
