Constraint-based type systems enjoy a long history.
Mitchell~\cite{mitchell84} and Reynolds~\cite{reynolds85}
developed the use of constraints for type inference and subtyping.
%
Trifonov and Smith~\cite{trifonov96}
proposed a type system where types are refined by subtyping
constraints.  Dependent types are not supported.
%
Pottier~\cite{pottier96simplifying,pottier01b}
presents a constraint-based type system for an ML-like language with
subtyping.

HM(X)~\cite{sulzmann97type,pottier01a,pottier-remy-attapl}
is a constraint-based framework
for Hindley--Milner style type systems.
The framework is parameterized on the specific constraint system
X; instantiating X yields extensions of the HM type system.
Constraints in HM(X) are over types, not values.

Several systems have been proposed that refine types in a base
type system through constraints.
%
{\em Refinement types}~\cite{refinement-types} extend the 
Hindley--Milner type system with intersection, union, and
constructor types, enabling specification and inference of
more precise type information.
%
{\em Conditional
types}~\cite{conditional-types} extend refinement types to
encode control-flow information in the types.
%
Jones introduced {\em qualified types}, which permit
types to be constrained by a finite set of
predicates~\cite{jones94}.
%
{\em Sized types}~\cite{sized-types}
annotate types with the sizes of recursive data structures.
Sizes are linear functions of size variables.
Size inference is performed using a constraint solver for
Presburger arithmetic~\cite{omega}.
% contraints on types, support primitive recursion only

% Indexed types~\cite{indexed-types}

Our work is most closely related to DML, the extension of ML with dependent types. We discuss this in detail in the next section.

% Jay and Sekanina 1996: array bounds checking based on shape
% types.

With hybrid type-checking~\cite{flanagan-popl06,flanagan-fool06},
types can be constrained by arbitrary boolean expressions.
While typing is undecidable, dynamic checks are inserted into
where the type-checker cannot accept or reject a program.

% Ada dependent types.
% Ada has constrained array definitions.  A constraint

% there other dependent types?  Generics are dependent?

Singleton types~\cite{aspinall-singletons,stone00} are dependent
types containing only one value.  
In Stone's formulation~\cite{stone00},
$S(e : \tau)$
is the type of all values of type $\tau$ that are equal to $e$.
Term equivalence is
constructed so that type-checking is decidable.
The singleton $S(e: \tau)$ can be encoded in CFJ as
$\tau(:{\tt self} {\tt =} \lfloor e \rfloor)$, where 
$\lfloor e \rfloor$ lifts $e$ to a constraint term.

        % to find paper)

Several languages---gbeta~\cite{ernst99-gbeta},
Scala~\cite{scala-overview,scala-oopsla05}, J\&~\cite{nqm06} and
others~\cite{oz01,ocrz-ecoop03}---provide {\em path-dependent
types}.  For a final access path {\tt p}, {\tt p.type}
in Scala is the singleton type containing the object {\tt p}.
In J\& {\tt p.class} is a type containing all objects
whose run-time class is the same as {\tt p}'s.
Scala's {\tt p.type} can be encoded in CFJ using an equality
constraint {\tt C(:self == p)}, where {\tt C} is a supertype of
{\tt p}'s static type.
\eat{
These types can be encoded in CFJ by introducing a
{\tt type} property.

conditional types:

type of an expression can be constrained using information about
the results of run-time tests in the context surrounding the
expression.

e.g., can express that e2 is evaluated only if e1 is true

\begin{verbatim}
\y. case y of true => e1 | false => e2 :
        'a -> (true ? ('a ^ typeof(e1)) U (false ? ('a ^ typeof(e2))
\end{verbatim}

Types include type constructors applied to types.

\begin{verbatim}
        so,  true      : true
        but, (\x . x)  : 'a -> 'a
             node(l,r) : node('a tree, 'a tree)
\end{verbatim}


when checking a case branch, type of the expression being
matched refined to the include the type constructor for that
branch

captures some control flow analysis in the types

\begin{verbatim}
        t ::= t1 -> t2
                | c(..ti..) <-- type constructor
                | alpha
                | t1 U t2
                | t1 ^ t2
                | t1 ? t2
                | 0
                | 1

        sigma ::= t | \forall ..alpha.. t where ..ti <= tj..
\end{verbatim}

Pluggable and optional type systems were proposed by
Bracha~\cite{bracha04-pluggable} and provide another means of
specifying refinement types.
Type annotations, implemented in compiler plugins, serve only to
reject programs statically that might otherwise have dynamic
type errors.
CQual~\cite{foster-popl02} extends C with user-defined type
qualifiers.  These
qualifiers may be flow-sensitive and may be inferred. 
CQual supports only a fixed set of typing rules
for all qualifiers.
In contrast, the {\em semantic type qualifiers} of
Chin, Markstrum, and Millstein~\cite{chin05-qualifiers}
allow programmers to define typing rules for qualifiers
in a meta language that allows type-checking rules to be
specified declaratively.
JavaCOP~\cite{javacop-oopsla06} is a pluggable type system
framework for Java.  Annotations are defined in a meta language
that allows type-checking rules to be specified declaratively.
JSR 308~\cite{jsr308} is a proposal for adding user-defined type qualifiers
to Java.

\subsubsection{\DML}
Our work is most closely related to \DML{}, \cite{xi99dependent}, an
extension of ML with dependent types. \DML{} is also built
parameterically on a constraint solver. Types are refinement types;
they do not affect th eoperational semantics and erasing the
constraints yields a legal ML program.

At a conceptual level the intuitions behind the development of \DML{}
and constrained types are similar. Both are intended for practical
programming by mainstream programmers, both introduce a strict
separation between compile-time and run-time processing, are
parametric on a constraint solver, and deal with mutually recursive
data-structures, mutable state, and higher-order functions (encoded as
objects in the case of constrained types). Both support existential
types.

The most obvious distinction between the two lies in the target
domain: \DML{} is designed for functional programming, specifically
ML, whereas constrained types are designed for imperative, concurrent
OO languages. Hence technically our development of constrained types
takes the route of an extension to \FJ. But there are several other
crucial differences as well.

First, \DML{} achieves its separation by not permitting program
variables to be used in types. Instead, a parallel set of (universally
or existentially quantified) ``index'' variables have to be
introduced. For instance the typing of the {\tt app} operation on
lists is provided by:

{\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
fun('a)
  append(nil, ys) = ys
 | append(cons(x, xs), ys) = cons(x, append(xs,ys))
where append <| {m:nat}{n:nat} 
               'a list(m) * 'a list(n) -> 'a list(m+n)  
\end{verbatim}}
\noindent in contrast with the direct embedded expression with constrained types:
{\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
class List(int(:self >= 0) n) {
   Object item;
   List(n-1) tail;
   List(n+a.n) app(final List a) { 
     return n==0 ? a : new List(item, tail.app(a));}
   ...
}
\end{verbatim}}

Second, \DML{} permits only variables of basic index sorts known to
the constraint solver {e.g.{} {\tt bool}, {\tt int}, {\tt nat}) to
occur in types. In contrast, constrained types permit program
variables at any type to occur in constrained types. As with \DML,
only operations specified by the constraint system are permitted in
types. However, these operations always include field selection and
equality on object references.  (As we have seen permitting arbitary
type/property graphs may lead to undecidability.) Note that \DML{}
style constraints are easily encoded in constrained types.

Third, \DML{} does not permit any runtime checking of constraints
(dynamic casts).
