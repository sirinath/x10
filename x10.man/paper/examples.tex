The following section presents example uses of constrained types
using several different

\eat{
Many common object-oriented
idioms and
object-oriented type systems can be captured naturally using
constrained types: specifically we discuss types for places,
aliases,
ownership, arrays and clocks.  \ref{TODO}
}

\eat{
\ref{TODO}
Many of these constraint systems are more
expressive than the constraint system implemented in the current
\Xten{} compiler and have not (yet) been implemented.
}

\eat{
\ref{TODO}
In the following we will use the shorthand $\tt C(\bar{t}:c)$ for the
type $\tt C(:\bar{f}=\bar{t},c)$ where the declaration of the class
{\tt C} is $\tt \class\ C(\bar{\tt T}\ \bar{\tt f}:c)\ldots$  Also,
we abbreviate $\tt C(\bar{t}:\true)$ as $\tt C(\bar{t})$.
Finally, we use the shorthand $\tt T\;x=t;~c$ for the constraint
$\tt T\;x;~x=t;~c$.
}

\eat{
Finally, we
will also have need to use the shorthand
${\tt C}_1(\bar{t}_1:{\tt c}_1)\& \ldots {\tt C}_k(\bar{\tt t}_k:{\tt c}_k)$
for the type
${\tt C}_1(:\bar{\tt f}_1=\bar{\tt t}_1, \ldots,
            \bar{\tt f}_k=\bar{\tt t}_k,{\tt c}_1,\ldots,{\tt c}_k)$ 
provided that the ${\tt C}_i$ form a subtype chain
and the declared fields of ${\tt C}_i$ are ${\tt f}_i$.

Constraints naturally allow for partial specification
(e.g., inequalities) or incomplete specification (no constraint on a
variable) with the same simple syntax. In the example below,
the type of {\tt a} does not place any constraint on the second
dimension of {\tt a}, but this dimension can be used in other
types (e.g., the return type).
\begin{xten}
  class Matrix(int m, int n) {
    Matrix(m,a.n) mul(Matrix(:m==this.n) a) {...}
    ...
  }
\end{xten}

Constraints also naturally permit the expression of existential types:
\begin{xten}
  class List(int length) { 
    List(:length <= this.length) filter(Comparator k) {...} 
    ...
  }
\end{xten}
\noindent
Here, the length of the list returned by the \xcd{filter} method is 
unknown, but is bound by the length of the original list.

\subsection{Presburger constraints: array bounds}

Xi and Pfenning proposed using dependent types for eliminating
array bounds checks~\cite{xi98array}.
\Xten{} does not (yet) support generic types, however XXX
%
In CFJ, an array of type \xcd{T[]} indexed by (signed) integers
can be modeled as a class with the following
signature:\footnote{For this example, we assume generics
are supported.}
\begin{xten}
interface Array<T>(int(:self >= 0) length) {
  T get(int(:0 <= self, self < this.length) i);
  void set(int(:0 <= self, self < this.length) i, T v);
}
\end{xten}

Bounds can be checked using a constraint system based on
Presburger arithmetic~\cite{omega}.  Constraint terms include
integer constraints, scalar multiplication, and addition;
constraints include inequalities:
\fi


\eat{
Some code that iterates over an array (sugaring {\tt get} and {\tt set}):
\begin{xten}
double dot(double[] x, double[] y
         : x.length == y.length) {
  double r = 0.; 
  for (int(:self >= 0, self < x.length)
       i = 0; i < x.length; i++) {
    r += x[i] * y[i];
  }
  return r;
}
\end{xten}
}

\eat{
Another one:
\begin{xten}
double[](:length = x.length) saxpy(double a, double[] x, double[] y : x.length = y.length) {
    double[](:length = x.length) result = new double[x.length];
    for (int(:self >= 0, self < x.length) i = 0; i < x.length; i++) {
        result[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];
    }
    return result;
}
\end{xten}
}

% \subsection{Presburger constraints: blocked LU factorization}

\subsection{Equality constraints}

The \Xten{} compiler includes a simple equality-based constraint
system, described in Section~\ref{sec:lang}.
Equalities constraints
are used throughout \Xten{} programs.  For example, to ensure
$n$-dimensional arrays are indexed only be $n$-dimensional
index points, the array access operation requires that the
array's \xcd{rank} property be equal to the index's \xcd{rank}.

Equality constraints specified in the \Xten{} run-time library are used by the
compiler to generate efficient code.  For instance, an iteration over
the points in a region can be optimized to a set of nested loops
if the constraint on the region's type specifies that the region
is rectangular and of constant rank.


\eat{
\subsection{Equality constraints with disjunction: place types}

This example is due to Satish Chandra. We wish to specify a balanced
distributed tree with the property that its right child is always at
the same place as its parent, and once the left child is at the same
place then the entire subtree is at that place.  In
\Xten{}, every object has a field {\tt location} of type
{\tt place} that specifies the location at which the object is located.
%
The desired property may be specified thus:
\begin{xten}
class Tree(boolean localLeft) extends Object {
  Tree(:!this.localLeft || (location==here && self.localLeft)) left; 
  Tree(:location==here) right);
  ...
}
\end{xten}
The constraint on \xcd{left} states that if the \xcd{localLeft} property is
true for the current node, then the location of the \xcd{left} child must be
\xcd{here} and its \xcd{localLeft} property must be set.  This ensures,
recursively, that the entire left subtree will be located at the same place.
}

\subsection{Presburger constraints}

Presburger constraints are linear integer inequalities.
%A constraint solver plugin was implemented using a port to Java of the
%Omega library.~\cite{omega,scale}
%A separate implementation
%of a Presburger constraint solver was implemented using
%CVC3~\cite{cvc}. 
A Presburger constraint solver plugin was implemented using
CVC3~\cite{cvclite,cvc}.  The list example in
Figure~\ref{fig:list-example} type-checks using this constraint system.

Presburger constraints are particularly useful in a
high-performance computing setting where array operations are
pervasive.
Xi and Pfenning proposed using dependent types for eliminating
array bounds checks~\cite{xi98array}.  A Presburger constraint
system can be used to keep track of array dimensions and array
indices to ensure bounds violations do not occur.

\subsection{Set constraints: region-based arrays}

Rather than using Presburger constraints, 
\Xten{} takes another approach:
following ZPL~\cite{ZPL}, arrays in \Xten{}
are defined over
{\em regions},
sets of $n$-dimensional {\em index points}~\cite{gps06-arrays}.
For instance, the region \xcd{[0:200,}\xcd{1:100]} specifies a
collection of two-dimensional points \xcd{(i,j)} with \xcd{i}
ranging from \xcd{0} to \xcd{200} and \xcd{j} ranging from
\xcd{1} to \xcd{100}.

Regions and points were modeled in CVC3~\cite{cvc} to create a
constraint solver that ensures array bounds
violations do not occur:
an array access type-checks if the index point can be statically
determined to be in the region over which the array is defined.

Region constraints are subset constraints
written as calls to the \xcd{contains}
method of the \xcd{region} class.
The constraint solver does not actually evaluate the calls to
the \xcd{contains} method, rather it interprets these calls
symbolically
as subset constraints at compile time.

Constraints have the following syntax:

{
\small
\begin{tabular}{r@{\quad}rcl}
\\
  (Constraint)   &\xcd{c} &::=& \xcd{r.contains(r)} \bnf \dots \\
  (Region) &\xcd{r} &::=& \xcd{t} \bnf [${\tt b}_1$:${\tt d}_1$,\ldots,${\tt b}_k$:${\tt d}_k$]
           \\
           &        &  \bnf &
           \xcd{r | r} \bnf \xcd{r & r} \bnf \xcd{r - r}
           \\
           &        &  \bnf &
           \xcd{r + p} \bnf \xcd{r - p} \\
  (Point)  &\xcd{p} &::=& \xcd{t} \bnf $[{\tt b}_1,\ldots,{\tt b}_k]$ \\
(Integer)&\xcd{b},\xcd{d} &::=& \xcd{t} \bnf \xcd{n} \\
\\
\end{tabular}
}

\noindent
where \xcd{t} are constraint terms (properties and final variables)
and \xcd{n} are integer literals.

Regions used in constraints are either constraint terms \xcd{t},
region constants, unions (\xcd{|}), intersections (\xcd{&}),
or differences (\xcd{-}), or regions where each point is
offset by another point \xcd{p} using \xcd{+} or \xcd{-}.

\caption{Successive over-relaxation with regions}
\label{fig:sor}
\end{figure}

For example, the code in Figure~\ref{fig:sor} performs a successive
over-relaxation~\cite{sor} of a matrix \tcd{G} with rank 2.
The function declares a region variable \tcd{outer} as an alias for
\tcd{G}'s region and a region variable \tcd{inner} to be 
the subset of \tcd{outer} that excludes the boundary points,
formed by intersecting the \tcd{outer} region with itself shifted up, down,
left, and right by one.
The function then declares two more regions \tcd{d0} and \tcd{d1},
where ${\tt d}_i$ is set of points ${\tt x}_i$ where
$({\tt x}_0, {\tt x}_1)$ is in \tcd{inner}.  The function
iterates multiple times over points \tcd{i} in \tcd{d0}.
The syntax \tcd{finish} \tcd{foreach} (line 22) tells the
compiler to execute each loop iteration in parallel and to wait
for all concurrent activities to terminate.
The inner loop (lines 24--28) iterates over a subregion of
\tcd{inner}.

The type checker establishes that the \tcd{region} property of
the point \tcd{ij} (line 24) is \tcd{inner}
\xcd{&}~\xcd{[i..i,d1min..d1max]}, and that this region is a
subset of \tcd{inner}, which is in turn a subset of \tcd{outer},
the region of the array \tcd{G}.
Thus, the accesses to the array in the loop body
do not violate the bounds of the array.

A key to making the program type-check is that the region
intersection that defines \tcd{inner} (lines 10--11)
is explicitly intersected with \tcd{outer} so that the 
constraint solver can determine that
the result is a subset of \tcd{outer}.


\eat{
\subsection{AVL trees and red--black trees}

AVL trees and red-black trees can be modeled so that the
data structure invariant is enforced statically.

\begin{xten}
class AVLTree(int(:self >= 0) height) {...}
class Leaf(Object key) extends AVLTree(0) {...}
class Node(Object key, AVLTree l, AVLTree r
         : int d=l.height-r.height; -1 <= d, d <= 1) 
    extends AVLTree(max(l.height,r.height)+1) {...}
\end{xten}

Red--black trees may be modeled similarly. Such trees have the
invariant that (a) all leaves are black, (b) each non-leaf node has
the same number of black nodes on every path to a leaf (the black
height), (c) the immediate children of every red node are black.
\begin{xten}
class RBTree(int blackHeight) {...}
class Leaf extends RBTree(0) { int value; ... }
class Node(boolean isBlack, 
           RBTree(:this.isBlack || isBlack) l, 
           RBTree(:this.isBlack || isBlack,
                   blackHeight=l.blackHeight) r)
    extends RBTree(l.blackHeight+1) { int value; ... }
\end{xten}
}

\eat{
\subsection{Self types and binary methods}

Self types~\cite{bsg95,bfp-ecoop97-match} can be implemented
using a {\tt klass} property on objects.  The {\tt klass}
property represents the run-time class of the object.
Self types can be used to solve the binary method problem \cite{bruce-binary}.

In the example below, the {\tt Set} interface has a {\tt union} method
whose argument must be of the same class as {\tt this}.
\noindent This enables the {\tt IntSet} class's {\tt union}
method to access the {\tt bits} field of its argument {\tt s}.
\begin{xten}
  interface Set(:Class klass) {
    Set(this.klass) union(Set(this.klass) s);
  }
  class IntSet(:Class klass) implements Set(klass) {
    long bits;

    IntSet(IntSet.class)() { property(IntSet.class); }

    IntSet(IntSet.class)(int(:0 <= self, self <= 63) i) {
      property(IntSet.class);
      bits = 1 << i; }

    Set(this.klass) union(Set(this.klass) s) {
      IntSet(this.klass) r = new IntSet(this.klass);
      r.bits = this.bits | s.bits;
      return r; }
  }
\end{xten}
\noindent
The key to ensuring that this code type-checks is the
\rn{T-constr}
rule.
With a constraint system ${\cal C}_{\mathsf{klass}}$ aware of
the {\tt klass} property, the rule 
\rn{T-var} is used to subsume an expression of type
${\tt Set(this.class)}$ to type ${\tt IntSet(this.class)}$
when {\tt this} is known to be an {\tt IntSet}:
{\footnotesize
\[
\from{\begin{array}{c}
{\tt IntSet}~{\tt this}, {\tt Set}({\tt this.klass})~{\tt s}
        \vdash {\tt Set}({\tt this.klass})~{\tt s} \\
{\tt IntSet}~{\tt this}, {\tt Set}({\tt this.klass})~{\tt s}
        \vdash_{{\cal C}_{\mathsf{klass}}} {\tt IntSet}({\tt this.klass})~{\tt s} \\
\end{array}}
\infer{
{\tt IntSet}~{\tt this}, {\tt Set}({\tt this.klass})~{\tt s}
        \vdash {\tt IntSet}({\tt this.klass})~{\tt s}}
\]}

\subsection{Binary search}

An informal study by Jon Bentley~\cite{programming-pearls}
found that x\% of professional programmers attending in a course
could not correctly implement binary search.

Dependent types can help here by adding the invariants to the
index types.

\subsection{Ownership constraints}

\begin{figure}[t]
\inputxten{LO.x10}
\caption{Ownership types}
\label{fig:ownership}
\end{figure}

Using a simple extension of \Xten{}'s built-in equality
constraint system,
constrained types can also be used to encode a form of ownership
types~\cite{ownership-types,liskov-popl2003}.

Figure~\ref{fig:ownership} shows a fragment of a \xcd{List}
class with ownership types.
Each \xcd{Owned} object has an \xcd{owner} property.  Objects
also have properties that are used as owner parameters.
%
The \xcd{List} class has an \xcd{owner} property inherited from
\xcd{Owned} and also declares a \xcd{valOwner} property that is
instantiated with the owner of the values in the list, stored in
the \xcd{head} field of each element.  The \xcd{tail} of the
list is owned by the list object itself.

\Xten{}'s equality-based constraint system is sufficient for
tracking object ownership, however is does not capture all
properties of ownership type systems.
Ownership type systems enforce an ``owners as dominators''
property: the ownership relation forms a tree within the object
graph; a reference is not permitted to point directly to objects
with a different owner.
%
To encode this property, the owner of
the values \xcd{valOwner} must be contained within the owner
of the list itself; that is, \xcd{valOwner} must be \xcd{owner}
or \xcd{valOwner}'s owner must be contained in \xcd{owner}.
This is captured by the constraint \xcd{self.owns(owner)} on
\xcd{valOwner}.  Calls to the \xcd{owns} method in constraints
are interpreted by the ownership constraint solver as the
disjunction of conditions shown in the body of \xcd{owns}.
The object \xcd{world} is the root of the ownership tree; 
all objects are transitively owned by \xcd{world}.

For example, the type \xcd{List(:owner==world & valOwner == this)}
is invalid, because
its constraint is interpreted as
\xcd{owner == world & valOwner == this & this.owns(world)},
which is satisfiable only when \xcd{this == world} (which it is not).

An additional check is needed to ensure objects owned by
\xcd{this} are encapsulated.
The \xcd{tail()} method for instance, incorrectly leaks the
list's \xcd{tail} field.  To eliminate this case, the ownership
constraint system must additionally check that owner parameters
are bound only to 
\xcd{this}, \xcd{world}, or an owner property of \xcd{this}.
These conditions ensure that \xcd{tail()} can be called only on
\xcd{this} because its return type is otherwise not valid.
For instance, in the following code, the type of \xcd{ys} is
not valid because the \xcd{owner} property is bound to \xcd{xs}:
\begin{xten}
    final Owned o = ...;
    final List(:owner==o & valOwner==o) xs;
    List(:owner==xs & valOwner==o) ys = xs.tail();
\end{xten}

\fi

\if 0
\subsection{Disequalities: non-null types}

A constraint system that supports disequalities can be used to
enforce a non-null invariant on reference types.
A non-null type \xcd{C} can be written simply as \xcd{C(:self != null)}.
\fi

\eat{
\subsection{Clocked types}

Clocks are barriers that are adapted to a context where activities may be
dynamically created, and are designed so that all clock operations are
determinate.

For each arity $n$, we introduce a {\em Gentzen predicate}
${\tt clocked(\bar{t})}$. A $k$-ary Gentzen predicate $a$ satisfies the
property that $a(t_1,\ldots, t_k) \vdash a(s_1,\ldots,s_n)$ iff $k=n$
and $t_i=s_i$ for $i\leq k$.

Such a \xcd{clocked} atom is added to the context by an \xcd{clocked async}:
$$
\from{\Gamma, {\tt clocked(\bar{\tt v})} \vdash {\tt T}\ {\tt e}}
\infer{\Gamma \vdash {\tt T}\ {\tt async}\ {\tt clocked}(\bar{\tt v}) {\tt e}}
$$

A programmer can require that a method may be invoked only if the
invoking activity is registered on the clocks $\bar{\tt k}$ by adding
a \xcd{clocked} clause. The rule for method elaboration and method invocation then change:
$$
\begin{array}{l}
\from{ \bar{\tt T}\ \bar{\tt x}, {\tt C}\ \this, {\tt c},\clocked(\bar{\tt k}) \vdash {\tt S}\ {\tt e}, {\tt S} \subtype {\tt T} }   
\infer{\tt T\ m(\bar{\tt T}\,\bar{\tt x} : c) \clocked(\bar{\tt  k})\{\return\ e;\}\ \mbox{OK in}\ C}

\subsection{Activity-local objects}

Parallelism in \Xten{} is supported through lightweight asynchronous {\em
activities}, created by {\tt  async} statements.
It is often useful to restrict objects so that they are {\em local} to a
particular activity.
A local object may be accessed only by
the activity that created it or by an ancestor of that activity.
% it may be written only by the activity that created
% it or by a descendant of that activity.
Local objects are declared and created by qualifying their type
with {\tt  local}:
\begin{xten}
  local C o = new local C();
\end{xten}

To encode local objects in \Xten{}, we add an {\tt  activity}
property to objects:
\begin{xten}
  class Object(Activity activity) { ... }
\end{xten}
\noindent
where {\tt  Activity} has a possibly null {\tt  parent} property:
\begin{xten}
  class Activity(Activity parent) { ... }
\end{xten}
\noindent

To track the current activity ({\tt  z}), we augment typing judgments
as follows:
\[
  {\tt  z};~\Gamma \vdash {\tt  T}\ {\tt  e}
\]
\noindent where ${\tt  Activity}({{\tt  z}'})~{\tt  z} \in \Gamma$.
When the current activity is {\tt  z},
we encode the type {\tt  local C} as ${\tt  C}({\tt  z})$.

Spawning a new activity with an {\tt  async} statement
introduces a fresh activity ${\tt  z}'$:
\[
\from{
{\tt  z}';~\Gamma,~{\tt  Activity}({\tt  z})~{\tt  z'} \vdash {\tt  T}\ {\tt  e}\ \ \ 
\mbox{(${\tt  z}'$ fresh)}
}
\infer{
{\tt  z};~\Gamma \vdash {\tt  T}\ ({\tt  async}\ {\tt  e})
}
\]
The rule \rn{T-Field} is strengthened to require that reads 
only be performed on objects whose {\tt  activity} property is a
descendant of the current activity.
