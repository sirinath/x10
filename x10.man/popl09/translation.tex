This section describes an implementation approach for generic types in
\Xten{} on a JVM, with bytecode rewriting.

The design is a hybrid design combining techniques of run-time
instantiation from
NextGen~\cite{nextgen,allen03} and type-passing from
PolyJ~\cite{java-popl97}.  Generic classes are translated
into ``template'' classes that are instantiated on demand at run time by
binding the type properties to concrete types.
%
Constraints on values are erased from type references.
Adapter objects are used to represent type
properties and constraints.  
Run-time type tests (e.g., casts) are translated
into code that checks those constraints at run time.
%
This design has been implemented in the \Xten{} compiler, built
on the Polyglot compiler framework~\cite{ncm03}.  The compiler
translates \Xten{} source to Java source, which is then compiled
to Java bytecode using an off-the-shelf Java compiler.\footnote{There is also
a translation from \Xten{} to C++ source, not described here.}
The \Xten{} runtime is augmented with a class loader
implementation that performs run-time instantiation.

\paragraph{Classes.}
Each class is translated into a \emph{template class}.
The template class is compiled by a Java compiler (e.g., javac)
to produce a class file.
At run time, when a constrained type \xcd"C{c}" is first referenced, a
class loader loads the template class for \xcd"C" and then
transforms its bytecode, specializing it to the constraint
\xcd"c".  The implementation specializes code based on type constraints,
not value constraints; we leave value-constraint specialization to
future work.
%
For example, consider the following classes.
{
\begin{xten}
class A[X] {
  var a: X;
}
\end{xten}}
{
\begin{xten}
class C {
  val x: A[int] = new A[int]();
  val y: int = x.a;
}
\end{xten}}

The compiler generates the following Java code:
{
\begin{xten}
@Parameters({"X"})
class A {
  @TypeProperty public static class X { }
  public x10.runtime.Type X;
  X a;
  @Synthetic public A(Class X) { this(); }
}
\end{xten}}
{
\begin{xten}
class C {
  final A x = new A(int.class);
  final int y = Runtime.to$int(x.a);
}
\end{xten}}

The member class \xcd"A.X" is used in place of the
type property \xcd"X".   The field \xcd"X" of type
\xcd"x10.runtime.Type" captures the actual constrained type on which \xcd"A"
is instantiated, and is used for run-time type tests.
The \xcd"@Parameters" annotation on \xcd"A" is used during
run-time instantiation to identify the type properties.
Synthetic constructors with added \xcd"Class" parameters are
used to pass instantiation arguments to the \xcd"new"
expression.
This code is compiled to Java bytecode.

When an expression (e.g., \xcd"new C()") is evaluated,
the class \xcd"C" is loaded.
The class loader transforms the bytecode as if it had
been written as follows:

{
\begin{xten}
class C {
  final A$$int x = new A$$int();
  final int y = x.a;
}
\end{xten}}

The class loader rewrites allocations of template classes
(e.g., \xcd"new A(int.class)") into allocations of the
instantiated classes (i.e., \xcd"new A$$int()").
The template class name and actual type arguments are mangled to
derive the name of the instantiated class.
This code cannot be generated directly because
class \xcd"A$$int" does not yet exist; the Java source compiler
would fail to compile \xcd"C".

Upon evaluation of the constructor,
the class \xcd"A$$int" is loaded.
The class loader intercepts
this, demangles the name, and loads the bytecode for the
template class \xcd"A".
The bytecode is transformed, replacing the type property \xcd"X"
with the concrete type \xcd"int".

Parameter types are coerced to and from the actual type
\xcd"T" (a Java primitive type or \xcd"Object") using
method \xcd"Runtime.to$T(Object)" and \xcd"Runtime.from(T)",
possibly with additional casts.
Both are eliminated from the transformed
bytecode, but are needed for the template class to type-check.

\eat{
Currently, the class loader instantiates the template for
every encountered combination of parameters.  If desired,
it is possible (and relatively easy) to optimize this scheme
to instantiate only for the Java primitive types and Object,
giving nine possible instantiations per parameter.
}

%Instantiations are used for representation.
%Adapter objects are used for run time type information.
%
%Could do instantiation eagerly, but quickly gets out of hand without
%whole-program analysis to limit the number of instantiations: 9
%instantiations for one type property, 81 for two type
%properties, 729 for three.

%Constructors are translated to static methods of their
%enclosing
%class.
%Constructor calls
%are translated to calls to static methods.

Consider the code in Figure~\ref{fig:translation1}.  It contains most of the
features of generics that have to be translated.

\paragraph{Passing type arguments.}

For types visible at run time, annotations are used to
pass actual type arguments to the class loader.
The annotation \xcd"@InstantiateClass"
specifies the type parameter and
is placed on
fields, methods,
method parameters, and classes to
indicate instantiation parameters for field
types, method return types, method parameters, and superclasses,
respectively.
Interface instantiations are similarly handled
by \xcd"@InstantiateInterfaces".
The annotation
\xcd"@Instantiation"
is used for parametrized exceptions.
The class loader uses the arguments of the annotations to
propagate the instantiation information of the enclosing class
to the instantiation of annotated entities.  It then turns these
entities into references to the appropriate dynamically
instantiated classes.

Type arguments are passed to allocation expressions as
synthetic constructor arguments.  Run-time type tests and casts
receive type parameters via the \xcd"Runtime.cast$" and
\xcd"Runtime.instanceof$" helper methods.

\paragraph{Eliminating method type parameters.}

A parametrized
adapter class with an \xcd"apply" method
is generated for each parametrized method,
The adapter class
is annotated with \xcd"@ParametricMethod".
The parametrized method is invoked by instantiating the adapter
class through a generated factory method
and invoking its \xcd"apply()" method.

\paragraph{Parametrized exceptions.}

Parametrized exceptions are treated just like other classes.
Synthetic local classes, annotated with \xcd"@Instantiation",
are generated for each catch block with an instantiated
generic exception class.  Exception tables in the
bytecode are rewritten with the new exception types.

\paragraph{Run-time instantiation.}

The
\xcd"instanceof" and cast operations on
constrained types or type variables
are translated
to
similar operations on the instantiated type followed by calls
to
methods of the adapter object for the type
that evaluate the constraint.
% run-time constraint solving or other
% complex code that cannot be easily substituted in when rewriting
% the bytecode during instantiation.
