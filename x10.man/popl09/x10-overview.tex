This section presents an informal description of 
dependent and generic types in \Xten{}.  
As implemented, \Xten simplifies these 
semantics, limiting expressiveness in favor of usability.
After
using the design presented here to implement part of the \Xten runtime library,
we found that the semantics are
often difficult for the uninitiated to
\ifwild
use---indeed, they
provide comparable expressive power to Java wildcards, whose usability
issues are well known~\cite{wildcards-are-evil}.
\else
use.
\fi
These usability problems are explored in Section~\ref{sec:usability}.
The semantics that follow do not have the restrictions
imposed by the \Xten compiler; instead, they represent the core
of the \Xten type system.

\Xten{} is a class-based object-oriented language.
The language has a sequential core similar to Java or Scala, but
also
constructs for concurrency and distribution, as well as constrained
types, described here.  Like Java, the language provides single class
inheritance and multiple interface inheritance.
%\footnote{We plan
%to support traits in a future version of the language.}

A constrained type in \Xten{} is written \xcd"C{c}", where \xcd"C" is the
name of a class and \xcd"c" is a constraint on the properties
of \xcd"C" and the immutable state in scope at the type.  The
constraint \xcd"c" may refer to the value being constrained through
the special variable \xcd"self", which has type \xcd"C" in the
constraint.  Constraints are drawn from a constraint language that,
syntactically, is a subset of the boolean expressions of \Xten{}.  For
brevity, the constraint may be omitted and interpreted as \xcd"true".

To illustrate the features of dependent types in \Xten{}, we
develop a \xcd"List"
class.  We will present several versions of \xcd"List" as we
introduce new features.
A \xcd"List" class with a type property \xcd"T" and an \xcd"int"
property \xcd"len" is declared as in Figure~\ref{fig:list0}.
Classes in \Xten{} may be declared with any number of type properties and
value properties.

\begin{figure}
{
\begin{xtennoindent}
      class List[T](len: int) {
        var head: T;
        val tail: List[T];
        def get(i: int): T {
          if (i == 0) return head;
          else return tail.get(i-1);
        }
        def this[S](hd: S, tl: List[S]):
            List[S]{len==tl.len+1} {
          property[S](tl.len+1);
          head = hd; tail = tl;
        }
      }
\end{xtennoindent}
}
\caption{List example, simplified}
\label{fig:list0}
\end{figure}

For a class
\xcd"C"
with type properties
\xcdmath"X$_1$",
\dots,
\xcdmath"X$_k$",
we permit the positional syntax \xcdmath"C[T$_1$,$\dots$,T$_k$]"
to mean \xcdmath"C{X$_1$==T$_1$," \xcdmath"$\dots$," \xcdmath"X$_k$==T$_k$}".

Like in Scala, fields are declared using the keywords \xcd"var"
or \xcd"val".  The \xcd"List" class has a mutable \xcd"head"
field with type \xcd"T" (which resolves to \xcd"this.T"), and an
immutable (final) \xcd"tail" field with type \xcd"List[T]", that
is, with type \xcd"List{self.T==this.T}".  Note that \xcd"this" occurring
in the constraint refers to the instance of the enclosing
\xcd"List" class,
and \xcd"self" refers to the value being
constrained---\xcd"this.tail" in this case.

Methods are declared with the \xcd"def" keyword.
The method \xcd"get" takes a final integer \xcd"i" argument
and returns the element at that position.

Objects in \Xten{} are initialized with constructors, which
must ensure that all properties of the new object
are initialized and that the class invariants of the object's
class and its superclasses and superinterfaces hold.
\Xten{} uses method syntax with the name
\xcd"this" for constructors.
In \Xten{}, constructors have a ``return type'', which constrains
the properties of the new object.  The constructor in
Figure~\ref{fig:list0} takes a type argument \xcd"S"
and two value arguments \xcd"hd" and \xcd"tl".  The constructor
return type specifies that the constructor initializes the
object to have type \xcd"List[S]{len==tl.len+1}", that is,
\xcd"List{self.T==S," \xcd"self.len==tl.len+1}".
The formal parameter types and return types of both methods and
constructors may refer to final parameters of the same
declaration.

The body of the constructor
begins with a \xcd"property" statement that initializes the
properties of the new instance.  All properties are initialized
simultaneously and it is required that the property assignment
entail the constructor return type.
The remainder of the constructor assigns the fields of the
instance with the constructor arguments.

We next illustrate more advanced features of \Xten by
presenting a new version of \xcd"List", shown
in Figure~\ref{fig:list}.

\begin{figure}
{\footnotesize
\begin{xtenmathnoindent}
class List[T](len: int){len >= 0} {
  var head: T;
  val tail: List[T]{self.len==this.len-1};

  def get(i: int{0 <= self, self < len}){len > 0}: T {
    if (i == 0)
      return head;
    val tl = tail as List{len>0};
    val i1 = i-1 as int{0 <= self,self < tail.len};
    return tl.get(i1);
  }

  def map[S](f: T => S): List[S]{self.len==this.len} {
    return new List[S](f(head), tail.map[S](f));
  }

  def this[S](hd: S, tl: List[S]):
      List[S]{len==tl.len+1} {
    property[S](tl.len+1);
    head = hd; tail = tl;
  }

  def print(){T $\extends$ Printable} {
    head.print();
    println(", ");
    tail.print();
  }
}
\end{xtenmathnoindent}}
\caption{List example, with more functionality and more
constraints.}
\label{fig:list}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Class invariants}

Properties of a class may be constrained with 
a \emph{class invariant}.
The \xcd"List" declaration's class invariant in
Figure~\ref{fig:list} specifies that the length of
the list is non-negative.
The class invariant must be established by all constructors of
the class and can subsequently be assumed for all instances of the class.

For generic types, the invariant is used to provide subtyping
bounds on the type properties.
For example, in the following code,
\xcd"SortedList" 
specifies that the element type \xcd"T"
is a subtype of \xcd"Comparable":
\begin{xtenmath}
class SortedList[T] {T$\extends$Comparable[T]} {
  def sort() { ... x.compare(y) ... }
}
\end{xtenmath}


\subsection{Methods}

Method declarations in \Xten
may have additional
constraints, or \emph{guards}, on the method parameters
that must be satisfied for access.
The guard holds throughout the method body.

\eat{
The field declarations in Figure~\ref{fig:list}
each have a guard.  The guard on
\xcd"head" requires that \xcd"len" \xcd">" \xcd"0";
that is \xcd"this.head" may not be dereferenced
unless \xcd"this" has type \xcd"List{len>0}".  Similarly,
\xcd"tail" cannot be accessed unless the list has a non-empty tail.  The
compiler is free to generate optimized representations of
instances of \xcd"List" with a given length: it may remove
the \xcd"head" and \xcd"tail" fields for empty lists, for
instance.  Similarly, the compiler may specialize instances of
\xcd"List" with a given concrete type for \xcd"T".
\eat{
This
specialization is described in Section~\ref{sec:impl}.
}
}

The method \xcd"get" in Figure~\ref{fig:list}
has a constraint on the type of \xcd"i" that requires
that it be within the list bounds.
The method also has a guard that
requires that the actual
receiver's
\xcd"len" property must be positive---calls to \xcd"get" on empty
lists are not permitted.
A method with a guard is called a \emph{conditional method}.
The constraint on \xcd"get" ensures that the guard on 
\xcd"tail" is satisfied in the method body.
In the method body, the \xcd"head" of the list is returned for
position \xcd"0"; otherwise, the call recurses on \xcd"tail".
For this example to type-check, the constraint system
must establish
\eat{
the guard on \xcd"tail" and
}
the guard on the recursive call to \xcd"get".
This is done explicitly by performing run-time casts using the
\xcd"as" operator.\footnote{Support for flow-sensitive constraints
would obviate the need for
run-time casts in this context.}
\eat{
The constraint solver must prove
{\footnotesize
$$
\begin{array}[t]{l}
\tt len > 0, tail.len=len-1, 0 \leq i, i < len, i \not= 0 \\
\tt \quad\vdash tail.len > 0, 0 \leq i-1,i-1 < tail.len 
\end{array}
$$}
}

Method guards can also be constraints on type properties.
For instance, the \xcd"print" method can be invoked only if
\xcd"T" is instantiated on a type that implements
\xcd"Printable".  Since the guard holds in the body of the
method, the \xcd"print" method can be invoked on \xcd"head"---it
is guaranteed to implement \xcd"Printable".
This feature is similar to optional methods in CLU~\cite{clu}.
Using structural constraints on \xcd"T" would give more
expressive power; optional methods are discussed further in
Section~\ref{sec:discussion}.

Method overriding is similar to Java: a method of a subclass
with the same name and parameter types overrides a method of the
superclass.  An overridden method may have a return type that is
a subtype of the superclass method's return type.
A method guard may be weakened by an overriding
method; that is, the guard in the superclass must entail the  
guard in the subclass.

Methods may also have type parameters.  
For instance, the \xcd"map" method in Figure~\ref{fig:list} 
has a type parameter \xcd"S" and a value parameter that is a
function from \xcd"T" to \xcd"S".
A parametrized method is invoked by giving type arguments before the
expression arguments (see recursive call to
\xcd"map").\footnote{Actual type arguments can be inferred from the types
of the value arguments. Type inference is out of the scope of this paper.}

\eat{
\xcd"List" also defines three constructors: the first
constructor takes no value arguments and initializes
the length to \xcd"0".  Note that \xcd"head" and \xcd"tail" are
not assigned since they are inaccessible.
The second constructor takes an argument for the head of the
list; the third takes both a head and tail.
}

\subsection{Type constraints and variance}
\label{sec:variance}

Type properties and subtyping constraints may be used in \Xten{} to 
provide \emph{use-site variance}
constraints.
Use-site variance based on structural virtual types was proposed by
Thorup and Torgerson~\cite{unifying-genericity} and extended for
parametrized type systems by Igarashi and
Viroli~\cite{variant-parametric-types}.  The latter type system lead
to the development of wildcards in
Java~\cite{Java3,adding-wildcards,wildcards-safe}.  \Xten's
support for use-site variance
has similar expressive power.
Section~\ref{sec:wildcards} describes a characterization of
wildcards using generic constrained types.

Consider the following subtypes  of \xcd"List" from
Figure~\ref{fig:list}.
\begin{itemize}
\item \xcd"List".  This type has no constraints on the type
property \xcd"T".
Any type that constrains \xcd"T",
is a subtype of \xcd"List".  The type \xcd"List" is equivalent to
\xcd"List{true}".
%
For a \xcd"List" \xcd"xs", the return type of the \xcd"get" method
is \xcd"xs.T".
Since the property \xcd"T" is unconstrained,
the caller can only assign the return value of \xcd"get"
to a variable of type \xcd"xs.T" or of type \xcd"Object".

\item \xcd"List{T==float}".
The type property \xcd"T" is bound to \xcd"float".
For a final expression \xcd"xs" of this type,
\xcd"xs.T" and \xcd"float" are equivalent types and can be used
interchangeably.
The syntax \xcd"List[float]" is used as
shorthand for \xcd"List{T==float}".

\item \xcdmath"List{T$\extends$Collection}".
This type constrains \xcd"T" to be a subtype of \xcd"Collection".
All instances of this type must bind \xcd"T" to a subtype of
\xcd"Collection"; for example \xcd"List[Set]" (i.e.,
\xcd"List{T==Set}") is a subtype of
\xcdmath"List{T$\extends$Collection}" because \xcd"T==Set" entails
\xcdmath"T"
\xcdmath"$\extends$"
\xcdmath"Collection".
%
If \xcd"xs" has the type \xcdmath"List{T$\extends$Collection}",
then the return type of \xcd"get" has type \xcd"xs.T", which is an unknown but
fixed subtype of \xcd"Collection"; the return value can be
assigned into a variable of type \xcd"Collection".

\item \xcdmath"List{T$\super$String}".  This type bounds the type property
\xcd"T"
from below.  For a \xcd"List" \xcd"xs" of this type, any
supertype of \xcd"String" may flow into a variable of type \xcd"xs.T".
The return type of the \xcd"get"
method is known to be a
supertype of \xcd"String" (and implicitly a subtype of \xcd"Object").
\end{itemize}

In the positional syntax for types (e.g., \xcd"List[T]"),
an actual type argument \xcd"T" may optionally
be annotated
with
a \emph{use-site variance tag}, either ``\xcd"+"'' or ``\xcd"-"'':
if \xcd"X" is a type property of \xcd"C", then
the syntax \xcd"C[+T]" is shorthand for \xcdmath"C{X$\extends$T}" and
\xcd"C[-T]" is shorthand for \xcdmath"C{X$\super$T}"; of course,
\xcd"C[T]" is shorthand for \xcd"C{X==T}".



\eat{
\subsection{Type properties}

Type properties may be declared invariant, covariant, or
contravariant.
If a property \xcd"X" of a class \xcd"C" is covariant,
then if \xcd"S" is a subtype of
\xcd"T", the type \xcd"C{X==S}" is a subtype of \xcd"C{X==T}".
Similarly, if \xcd"X" is contravariant, 
\xcd"C{X==T}" is a subtype of \xcd"C{X==S}".
It is illegal for a covariant property to occur in a negative
position in its class declaration and for a contravariant
property to occur in a positive position.  A position is
negative if it is a formal parameter type, or occurs in a method
where clause.  A position is positive if it is a return type or
occurs in a method constraint.
}

\eat{
\subsection{Methods}

Methods in \Xten{} are declared with the \xcd"def" keyword.
The \xcd"List" class in Figure~\ref{fig:list} declares methods
\xcd"get" and \xcd"map".

Like Java, \Xten{} supports both instance and static methods.
Since a type property is an instance member, a static method may
not refer to a type property of the class.

Interfaces are also permitted to have static methods.  Classes
implementing the interface must provide an implementation of the
static methods of the interface.
This feature is
useful when a type property \xcd"T" is constrained to implement
an interface \xcd"I"; static methods of \xcd"I" can be invoked
through \xcd"T".
}

\eat{
\subsection{Interfaces}

optional interfaces
value properties in interfaces
static methods in interfaces

\subsubsection{Optional methods and interfaces}

Method constraints also provide support for optional methods.

{
\begin{xtenmath}
class List[T] {
  ...
  def print(){T $\extends$ Printable} {
    for (x: T in this)
      x.print();
}
}
\end{xtenmath}}

\xcd"List.print" may only be called on lists instantiated on
subtypes of the \xcd"Printable" interface.

Optional methods generalize to optional interfaces.

{\footnotesize
\begin{xtenmath}
interface Printable { def print(); }

class List[T] implements Printable if {T $\extends$ Printable} {
  ...
  def print(){T $\extends$ Printable} {
    for (x: T in this)
      x.print();
  }
}
\end{xtenmath}}

In this case \xcd"List" implements the \xcd"Printable" interface
only if \xcd"List.T" implements \xcd"Printable".
Thus \xcd"List{T==String}"
and \xcd"List{T==List[String]}"
are subtypes of \xcd"Printable", but
\xcd"List{T" \xcd"==FourLetterWord}" is not.


Without optional interfaces, \xcd"List" cannot be a subtype
of \xcd"Printable".  The constraint \xcdmath"{T $\extends$ Printable}" on
the \xcd"print" method is more restrictive than the 
constraint (i.e., \xcd"true") on 
\xcd"Printable.print".
}

\subsection{Type properties vs. type parameters}
\label{sec:usability}
\label{sec:parameters-vs-fields}

As previously mentioned, after implementing the \Xten design above,
we encountered some usability problems.
\ifwild
The first
\else
The basic
\fi
problem is that programmers are more familiar with
\emph{type parameters} than with \emph{type properties}:
providing similar functionality with often subtle distinctions
can be difficult for novices users of the language.
\ifwild
Second, permitting type constraints at the use site
of a type rather than at the definition site, as is done for
instance in Java~\cite{adding-wildcards}, can lead to 
subtle design bugs in programs.
\fi

The key difference between type parameters and type properties
is that type properties are
instance members bound during object construction.  Type
properties are thus accessible through expressions---\xcd"e.T" is
a legal type (if \xcd"e" is final)---and are inherited by subclasses.
These features gives type properties more expressive power than
parameters, but are unfamiliar to many programmers.

One complication is that,
since type properties are inherited, the language design needs
to account for ambiguities introduced when the same name is
used for different type properties declared in or inherited into a class.
These can be disambiguated
by ``casting'' the target up to the desired supertype,
e.g., \xcd"(e as C).X" specifies
the property \xcd"X" inherited from \xcd"C".

As an example, in the following \Xten code, \xcd"HashMap" 
inherits the properties \xcd"K" and \xcd"V" from \xcd"Map".
\begin{xten}
interface Map[K,V] {
  def get(K): V;
  def put(K, V): V;
}

class HashMap extends Map {
  def get(k: K): V = ...;
  def put(k: K, v: V): V = ...;
}
\end{xten}
If a user is used to type parameters, \xcd"HashMap" would be
declared as follows:
\begin{xten}
class HashMap[K,V] extends Map[K,V] {
  def get(k: K): V = ...;
  def put(k: K, v: V): V = ...;
}
\end{xten}
This introduces a new pair of type properties named \xcd"K" and
\xcd"V" that shadow the inherited properties,
and adds to the class invariant of \xcd"HashMap" the constraint
\xcd"{(this as Map).K==K," \xcd"(this as Map).V==V}".
A naive implementation of type properties would store run-time
type information for all four properties in each instance
of \xcd"HashMap".

\ifwild
The second problem encountered was the difficulty with using use-site
variance annotations.
When writing a generic type in, say, a method signature, it is often not 
clear whether to constrain the generic's type property with an
equality constraint or with a subtyping constraint.
For example, in the following code, \xcd"C.list()" returns a \xcd"List[X]".
\begin{xtenmath}
class List[T] {
  def add(x: T) = ...;
}
class C[X] {
  def list(): List[X] = ...;
}
\end{xtenmath}
\noindent
But, it could just return
\xcdmath"List{T$\extends$X}" instead.
Which to use depends on whether the developer of \xcd"C"
expects the list to be mutated or not: if \xcd"xs"
is of type
\xcdmath"List{T$\extends$A}", then \xcd"xs.add" cannot be
invoked with a value of static type \xcd"A"---the compiler
cannot demonstrate that \xcd"A" is a subtype of \xcd"xs.T".
If the developer chooses wrongly, correcting the problem can
cascade throughout the program.
\fi

To correct these problems, a
revised \Xten design
imposes
restrictions on type properties so that they 
behave similarly to type
\ifwild
parameters with definition-site variance.
\else
parameters.\footnote{We have implemented a further
simplification of this new design, moving variance annotations
to the definition site.}
\fi

\ifwild
First, we
\else
We
\fi
make the syntax \xcd"e.X"
illegal and permit type properties to be accessible only from
within the body of their class definition via the
implicit \xcd"this" qualifier.  We require that type
constraints be written using the shortened \xcd"C[T]"
\ifwild
syntax rather than as \xcd"C{X==T}".
\else
(or \xcd"C[+T]", etc.) syntax rather than as \xcd"C{X==T}" (\xcd"C{X<=T}").
\fi
The compiler also addresses the
ambiguous type property problem by ensuring inherited type properties are
not visible from subclasses.

\ifwild
Second, we allow the programmer to specify
\emph{definition-site}
variance annotations.
If a type property \xcd"X" of \xcd"C" is declared ``\xcd"+X"'', it is
covariant.
This simply means that \xcd"C[T]"
is shorthand for \xcd"C{X<=T}" rather than for \xcd"C{X==T}".
In addition, the compiler checks that in the body of \xcd"C",
\xcd"X" is only used in positive positions (method return types
and types of final (\xcd"val") fields).
As far as the programmer is concerned, then, if \xcd"A"
is a subtype of \xcd"B", then
\xcd"C[A]" is a subtype of \xcd"C[B]".
This follows because \xcd"X<=A" entails \xcd"X<=B" if \xcd"A<=B".
Dually, a property \xcd"X" can be declared contravariant 
using ``\xcd"-X"'', meaning \xcd"C[T]" is shorthand for
\xcd"C{X>=T}".  \xcd"X" may not appear only in negative
positions (method argument types).
\fi

With these
modifications, explicit type constraints continue to be allowed
in method and constructor guards and in class invariants.
\ifwild\else
In this design, unconstrained types (e.g., \xcd"C") are still legal types.
\fi
