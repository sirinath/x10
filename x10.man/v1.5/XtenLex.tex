\chapter{Lexical structure}

XXX Java

In general, \Xten{} follows \java{} rules \cite[Chapter 3]{jls2} for
lexical structure.

Lexically a program consists of a stream of white space, comments,
identifiers, keywords, literals, separators and operators.

\paragraph{Whitespace}
% Whitespace \index{whitespace} follows \java{} rules \cite[Chapter 3.6]{jls2}.
ASCII space, horizontal tab (HT), form feed (FF) and line terminators constitute white space.


\paragraph{Comments}
% Comments \index{comments} follows \java{} rules
% \cite[Chapter 3.7]{jls2}. 
All text included within the ASCII characters ``\xcd"/*"'' and
``\xcd"*/"'' is
considered a comment and ignored. All text from the ASCII character
``\xcd"//"'' to the end of line is considered a comment and is ignored.

\paragraph{Identifiers}

Identifiers \index{identifier} are defined as in \java.
Identifiers consist of a single letter followed by zero or more
letters or digits.
Letters are defined as the characters for which the \java{}
method \xcd"Character.isJavaIdentifierStart" returns true.
Digits are defined as the ASCII characters \xcd"0" through \xcd"9".

\paragraph{Keywords}
\Xten{} reserves the following keywords:
\begin{xten}
abstract        any             as              async
ateach          atomic          await           break
case            catch           class           clocked
const           continue        current         def
default         do              else            extends
final           finally         finish          for
foreach         future          goto            has
here            if              implements      import
instanceof      interface       native          new
next            or              package         private
protected       public          return          self
static          super           switch          this
throw           throws          try             type
val             value           var             when
while
\end{xten}
Note that the primitive types are not considered keywords.
The keyword \xcd{goto} is reserved, but not used.

\paragraph{Literals}\label{Literals}\index{literals}

Literals are either integers, floating point numbers, booleans,
characters, strings, and \xcd"null".
\XtenCurrVer{} defines literal syntax in the same way as \java{} does.

\paragraph{Separators}
\Xten{} has the following separators and delimiters:
\begin{xten}
( )  { }  [ ]  ;  ,  .
\end{xten}

\paragraph{Operators}
\Xten{} has the following operators:
\begin{xten}
=>  <    !   ~   ?   :   ==  <=  
>=  !=   &&  ||  ++  --  +   - 
*   /    &   |   ^   %   <<  >> 
>>> +=   -=  *=  /=  &=  |=  ^=  
%=  <<=  >>= >>> =   ->  @
\end{xten}
