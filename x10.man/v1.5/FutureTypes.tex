\section{Future types}

The value class \xcd"Future[T]"
is the type of all \xcd"future" expressions.
The type represents a value which when forced will return a value of type
\xcd"T". Thus the type makes available the following methods:

\begin{xten}
package x10.lang;
public class Future[T] {
  public def force(): T;
  public def forced(): Boolean;
}
\end{xten}
