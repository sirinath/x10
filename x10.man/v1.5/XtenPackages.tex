\chapter{Names and packages}
\label{packages} \index{names}\index{packages}

\Xten{} supports \java's mechanisms for names and packages \cite[\S
6,\S 7]{jls2}, including {\tt public}, {\tt protected}, {\tt private}
and package-specific access control. 


\Xten{} supports the following naming conventions. Names of {\tt
value} classes should start with a lower-case leter, and those of {\tt
reference} classes with an upper-case letter. \Xten{} also 
supports the convention that fields, local variable names
and method parameter names that start with an uppercase letter are
automatically considered to be annotated with {\tt final}.

%% \Xten{} also supports \java{} 1.5 static imports \cite{jsr201}.
