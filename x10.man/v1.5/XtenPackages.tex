\chapter{Names and packages}
\label{packages} \index{names}\index{packages}

\Xten{} supports \java's mechanisms for names and packages \cite[\S
6,\S 7]{jls2}, including \xcd"public", \xcd"protected", \xcd"private"
and package-specific access control. 

Classes in the \Xten{} library support the following naming conventions.
Names of methods, fields, value properties, and packages are in camelCase and begin with a lowercase letter.
Names of types---including classes, type properties, type
parameters, and type specified by type definitions---are in CamelCase and begin with an uppercase letter.
Names of \xcd"const" fields are in all uppercase with words
separated by an ``\xcd"_"''.
