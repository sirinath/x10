\extrapart{Changes from v0.32}

This is the first reference manual that corresponds to a working
implementation. As such a number of details missing from v0.32 have
been spelt out. A number of mistakes have been corrected, and
clarifications added.

The semantics of exception handling across asynchronous activities has
been clarified.

Exploded syntax has been introduced to make it convenient to
destructure points. 

\subsection{Limitations}

\begin{itemize}
\item Exception propagation from an activity to its invoking activity is not
yet implemented.

\item All the type checking rules are not implemented. Thus if your program
is already correct, it will exeute correctly. If it is not correct, it
may still execute and give a result.

\item The predicate {\tt ==} for value types is not yet implemented.

\item ``Jagged'' arrays are not yet implemented.
\end{itemize}
\todo{Update this list from Mantisa.}

\subsection{Future work}

Language needs to be extended to support generic types, with
type and value parameters.

Language needs to be extended to support type inference.

Language needs to be extended to support implicit syntax.
