Programs under folder ./testedprogram were used in testing the
compiler implementations. Please note that, all files under
sub-folder "testingcompiler" are NOT for evaluation prupose;
they are just used to test whether the compiler is fully
implemented. Other files "ArraySum.x10", "Histogram.x10", "nbody.x10",
"KMeanDist.x10",, "NQueensPar.x10", "NQueensDist", and the
"fmm" application are used to evaluate the new data-centric
synchronization features. Those programs have been re-written
to use the new atomic sections.
