Inspect all @NativeRep classes for c++ backend and 
update serialization routines for 2.1 object model.

x10.compiler.RemoteOperation.
  Kill this code.  Won't work anymore.  
  Recode RA to use IndexedMemoryChunk directly.

x10.io.GlobalStringWriter
  Do we really want this class?  See todo in the class header.
  In general, normalize APIs for Global vs.Local operations,
    Need to think about StringBuilder, Printers, Writers, etc.
    Need to think about Console, Files, etc.

x10.util.
  Kill various Val<Foo> classes.  No longer needed in 2.1
