Need to look at serialization/deserialzation for all @NativeClass
classes and decide what to do.  Most likely outcome is to have
@NativeClass classes throw an exception if someone attempts to 
serialize them.

x10.io.GlobalStringWriter
  Do we really want this class?  See todo in the class header.
  In general, normalize APIs for Global vs.Local operations,
    Need to think about StringBuilder, Printers, Writers, etc.
    Need to think about Console, Files, etc.

x10.util.
  Kill various Val<Foo> classes.  No longer needed in 2.1
