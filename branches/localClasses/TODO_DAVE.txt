x10.lang.Array: copyTo/copyFrom
  (1) need to define variants that take a RemoteArray[T]
      currently code is just plain wrong.
  (2) serialization of array doesn't match new semantics because
      IndexedMemoryChunk is native.  Need to special case Array in compiler
      to get efficient implementation.

x10.compiler.RemoteOperation.
  Kill this code.  Won't work anymore.  
  Recode RA to use IndexedMemoryChunk directly.


x10.io.GlobalStringWriter
  Do we really want this class?  See todo in the class header.

x10.util.
  Kill various Val<Foo> classes.  No longer needed in 2.1
