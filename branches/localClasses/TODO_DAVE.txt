Serialization of x10.lang.array doesn't match new semantics because
IndexedMemoryChunk is native and (for other uses) needs to only send the address.  
Need to special case Array in compiler to get efficient implementation (avoid Any custom pickling path)

x10.compiler.RemoteOperation.
  Kill this code.  Won't work anymore.  
  Recode RA to use IndexedMemoryChunk directly.

x10.io.GlobalStringWriter
  Do we really want this class?  See todo in the class header.

x10.util.
  Kill various Val<Foo> classes.  No longer needed in 2.1
