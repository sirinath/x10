Prepare a list of questions about wala and wala.x10 bridge.

1. Position information of Finish/At
Wala maintains instructions' positions in separate tables. No need to add line/column in Instructions.
They can be retrieved by instruction index from its method.
cfg.getMethod - a sub class of AstMethod. AstMethod has source information. 
e.g. position = ((AstMethod)cfg.getMethod()).getSourcePosition();

Therefore, no need to change wala.x10 bridge. Neither for Finish nor for At.

2. Closure - source code of a closure
Julian needs to take a look at the callgraph generated by wala to figure out how closure is "translated". 
TODO: send Julian an example of closure and the callgraph generated by wala

3. Exceptions - Implement another ExceptionPrunedCFG to keep "intentional" exceptions. 
   Refer to the original ExceptionPrunedCFG
   
4. How types in wala are translated - wala follows Java's byte code convention
A better identifier is srcfile + position
