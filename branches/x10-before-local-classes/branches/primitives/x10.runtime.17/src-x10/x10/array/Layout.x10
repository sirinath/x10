/**
 * This class represents a memory layout for a local chunk of a
 * distributed array. Its purpose is to define the mapping from points
 * in the array over which the region is defined to the offset in raw
 * memory for the local chunk of the array.
 *
 * This class is decoupled from the Region class because we may wish
 * to support different memory layouts for the same Region. For
 * example, for non-rectangular regions the user may wish to select
 * between a rectangular layout (which has efficient access but wastes
 * storage) or a non-rectangular layout (which makes the opposite
 * tradeoff).
