/**
 * A closure corresponds to a slow invocation of a task. This 
 * class is intended to be subclassed by client code. Subclasses
 * may specify extra state (e.g. fields such as result),
 * and will supply implementations of the abstract methods compute
 * and executeAsInlet. The code for a slow invocation of a task
 * should live in compute. The code for executeAsInlet should
 * specify where the result of the closure is to be deposited
 * in the parent closure.
 * 
 * Each worker contains a closure at the top level. When the
 * topmost closure of a victim is stolen, a new child closure is
 * created from the topmost frame in the closure  and left
 * behind on the victim. The old closure is now a parent
 * and is moved to the thief, which starts executing it.
