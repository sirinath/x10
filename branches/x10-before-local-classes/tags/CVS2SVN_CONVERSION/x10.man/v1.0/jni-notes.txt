X10 native interface design goals

 -- make it easy to use native code to work on multidimensional X10
    arrays.

JNI permits instance methods to be native as well.

Java objects passed by reference.
Vm tracks objects passed to native code.

Native code has to access Java objects through opaque references (Java
object layout is not exposed).

Working with arrays.  X10 needs to provide array descriptor info to
the native side.

Registry for local references created on every transfer of control
from Java to native method.

Native code can access Java objet fields, and invoke java methods on
java objets.

Native code may throw Java exceptions.
