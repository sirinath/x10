How to debug deadlocks in the X10 runtime on AIX.
=================================================

rios2 is an AIX multiprocessor, and the JVM uses native threads. 
So race conditions often manifest themselves on rios2, whereas they may not
manifest themselves under Cygwin/Windows.

If you suspect a deadlock, go to another shell, find out the processid of
the JVM running ur X10 program, and execute: kill -3 <pid>

This sends a QUIT signal to the JVM, which responds by printing out a dump file
and terminating.

The dump file will tell you will contain an assertion that there is a deadlock 
(if there is one). In fact it will tell you which threads are in the deadlock loop.
Later in the dump file you will get a dump of the stack of each thread, so u can find
out precisely which code was executing at the time of the deadlock.
