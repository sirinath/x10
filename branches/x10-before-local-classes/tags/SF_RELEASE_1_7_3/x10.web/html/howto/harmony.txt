HOWTO: How to get Harmony running
==================================

You need two things:  A VM that will work with the class libraries and the class libraries themselves.  To get the first part, go here: http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/java/jdk/harmony/index.html.  To get the second part, use Subversion to check it out from here: https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/harmony/enhanced/classlib/trunk.

Once you've checked out Harmony, you'll need to build it (which requires ant, a C++ compiler and nmake) by cd-ing into trunk\make and running ant which will produce the results in trunk\deploy.  You then need to copy the supporting JVM into the correct place: trunk\deploy\jre\bin\default


Also, I misspoke.  Harmony supports all of the reflection classes currently used by the X10 implementation.  Therefore, the only thing we can't do using Harmony is the logging stuff in x10/lang/JavaRuntime.java which doesn't have any users anyway.
