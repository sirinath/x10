/**
 * Clock test for multiple clocks.
 * Testing semantics of next with multiple clocks.
 *
 * For a clock c: I cannot advance to my next phase
 * until all activities registered with me have executed
 * resume on me for the current phase,
 * and all activities scheduled for completion
 * in my current phase (with now(c)) have globally finished.
 *
 * My phase zero starts when I am declared/created.
 *
 * For an activity a: My next cannot advance to the
 * following statement, until all clocks
 * that I am currently registered with have advanced to
 * their next phase.
 *
 * next will do an implicit resume first on each of the clocks
 * I am registered with.
 *
 * I get registered with a clock c by creating/declaring c,
 * or by being enclosed in a clocked(...,c,...) statement.
 *
 * I can register a child activity of mine with some of the clocks
 * I am already registered with by
 * async(P) clocked(c1,..,cn) S
 *
 * Expected result of this test: should not deadlock.
 *
 * Important: The next's do not go in lock step in this test case!
 *
 * For example: activities using (e) may pass their nexts
 * as soon as all other activities using e have arrived
 * at their nexts: (c,e), (d,e) (c,d,e), although (c,d),(c),(d)
 * have not yet arrived at their nexts.
 *
 * Also see ClockTest15.
