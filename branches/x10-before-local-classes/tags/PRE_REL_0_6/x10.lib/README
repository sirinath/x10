This is the Toplevel Readme file for X10 Runtime System.

X10lib is a C/C++ API intended to be used to develop high-performance 
applications on top of clusters, using the X10 programming model. X10lib 
supports a notion of multiple places (nodes), a global address space across places,
asynchronous execution (asyncs), ordering (finish, clocks and
switches, fences), atomic execution, and global multi-dimensional
arrays.

X10lib is released under the terms of the Eclipse Public Licence, v1.0. Please see
eclipse-v10.html for more details.

Instructions for configuring, building, and installing the X10 Runtime System:

* Check out the source code from "x10.cvs.sf.net" with module name "x10.lib".
  This puts everything under "x10.lib" subdir in your current working directory.

* Change to "x10.lib" subdir and peform the enslited activities sequentially.

* Configure the Build Process
  ---------------------------

          Run './config.sh'.

  This creates "include" and "lib" subdirs under the toplevel for installation.
  It automatically detects header files located under src and its subdirs and
  establishes softlinks under "include/x10" for compile time symbol resolution.

* Build and Install the Library
  -----------------------------

          Run 'make all' followed by 'make install'.

  This puts 'libx10.a' under "lib" subdir of toplevel subdir.

* For creating sample executables, do 'make samples' after installation
  (This is must for linking those executables against the library).

* For regression testing, do 'make test' (Nothing for the moment).

* To erase the subdirs of build objects, use 'make clean'.  To restore the
  directory sturcture to the pre-configure state, do 'make realclean'.

* Benchmarking executables can be built using 'make bench' at the toplevel.
  Do this after 'make install' as linking should be done aganist the build
  library.  To run the specificed benchmark, change to the respective subdir
  and run the script appropriate to the system under consideration.
