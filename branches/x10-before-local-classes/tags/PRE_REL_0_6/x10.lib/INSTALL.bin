INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS
-------------------------

For successful installation and subsequent usage, the following hardware and
software requirements should be met:

Machine: Power5
OS: AIX ver 5.3
Switch: Federation/HPS
Software:
[Both Runtime and Development]
	BOS (Base Operating System) ver 5.3.0.40 (including Pthreads)
	POE (Parallel Operating Environment) ver 4.2.2.4
	RSCT (Reliable Scalable Cluster Technology)/LAPI ver 2.4.2.6
	IBM XL C/C++ Compiler ver 8.0.0.0
	LoadLeveler ver 3.3.2.4


INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------

After downloading the package to a temporary working directory, you can unzip
and untar it using the following command:

	$ cd ${TMP_WORK}

	$ gzip -d -c libx10-0.5_aix5.3_ppc.tar.gz | tar -x -v -f - 

Once this is done, libx10-0.5 directory will be created in the current
working directory and all the distribution files can be located under it.

	$ cd libx10-0.5

Run the provided install script 'install.sh' with a PREFIX pointing to
the top directory with respect to which all the other subdirectories
and files will get installed during the process.  The top directory
also becomes the X10LIB_HOME for subsequent library usage.

If PREFIX is not specified, then your home directory will become
the X10LIB_HOME and the entire installation will be done with respect to
your home directory.

	$ PREFIX=${PATH_TO_X10LIB_HOME} ./install.sh


INSTALLED COMPONENTS
--------------------

A successful execution of the above step will lead to the following files
in various subdirectories for regular usage:

${PATH_TO_X10LIB_HOME}/

		bin/x10libCC
		bin/x10libcc
		include/*.h
		include/*.tcc
		lib/libx10.a
		share/X10Lib/RELEASE.NOTES
		share/X10Lib/INSTALL
		share/X10Lib/epl-v10.html

during installation and manually remove the files and directories were
created during this process.
