\section{Performance Evaluation}\label{s:results}

The performance numbers for handwritten C application and for the
\XWS{} code are given below, for psuedo-depth-first search,
breadth-first search and the Shiloach Vishkin algorithm for spanning
tree (from top to bottom). Numbers are presented for two machines,
altair (containing 4 dual-core Opterons) on the left and moxie, a
32-processor Niagara on the right. The best numbers for ten
consecutive runs are presented.

The Java programs were run using the experimental Java 1.7 release on
both machines. C programs were compiled with Sun cc v 5.8 and Cilk
programs with the 5.3.2 compiler.

The graphs show good scaling for the \XWS{} version of applications on
both machines. In all cases the numbers for \XWS{} are better than
that for the C code at higher processor counts.

Cilk does not perform well for BFS. (We were unable to get a Cilk
version of SV running in time for the submission.)
