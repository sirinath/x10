These are the installation instructions for X10 Runtime System.

As this library is currently under development and meant only for internal
distribution, no custom scripts are included for installing the library and
its associated header files outside the directory structure.  All you have to
do is run

                $make install

in top level directory after build is completed.
(see README file more details)

Once this is done, libx10.a will be available under lib subdir and various
header files can be located under include subdir.  Ensure that Include and
Library search paths contain these subdirs for programming.
