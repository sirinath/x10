 * Test for array reference flattening. Checks that after flattening
 the variable x and y can still be referenced, i.e. are not 
 declared within local blocks.
  
  To check that this test does what it was intended to, examine
  the output Java file. It should have a series of local variables
  pulling out the subters of m(a[1,1]).
