Dirichlet Boundary conditions

Elliptic (type of linear PDE)
Hyperbolic
Parabolic
    An equation of the form Au_xx + 2Bu_xy + Cu_yy = F(x,y,u,u_x,u_y)
    is said to be
         elliptic if AC-BB > 0
         parabolic if AC-BB = 0
         hyperbolic if AC-BB < 0

Implicit methods See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explicit_and_implicit_methods

  Explicit and implicit methods are numerical methods for solving
  time-varying ODEs and PDEs. In an explicit method, Y(t+delta t) is
  presented explicitly as function of Y(t): Y(t+delta t) = F(Y(t)). In
  an implicit method, one solves an equation
      G(Y(t), Y(t+delta t)) = 0

Jacobian 

   The Jacobian matrix is the matrix of all first-order partial
   derivatives of a vector-valued function. Let F: R^n -> R^m be a
   function from Euclidean n-space to Euclidean m-space. Such a
   function is given by m real-valued component functions y_1(bar x),
   ..., y_m(bar x). The partial derivatives of these functions, if
   they exist can be organized in an m x n matrix, the Jacobian matrix
   of F thus:

  J_ij = do y_i/do x_j  for i in 1:m and j in 1:n

  The importance of the Jacobian is that it represents the best linear
  approximation of a differentiable function at a given point.

Laplace's Equation u_xx + u_yy + u_zz = 0 (in 3d), i.e. nabla^2 u = 0

Level 0 BiCGStab --- what is this??

Gradient function: 

  The gradient is a way to obtain a vector function from a scalar
  function. Let f(x,y,z) be a scalar function in 3d. grad f is the
  vector function grad f = u_x i + u_y j + u_z k.

Laplacian 

  In 3d, a scalar operator yielding for u(x,y,z) the value u_xx + u_yy
  + u_zz. It is sometimes written as nabla^2(u). Note that Laplacian u
  = (grad u) . (grad u), where . is inner product.


Poisson's Equation
     nabla^2 u = f(x,y,z) over a region R.

Parabolic, see Elliptic

Stiff problems

  Differential equations for which some numeric methods are
  numerically unstable.
