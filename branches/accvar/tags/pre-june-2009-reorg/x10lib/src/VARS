#Need to define the following symbols

ARMCI    y if using armci
X10BASE  path to x10lib installation -- base directory
GA_BASE  path to ga installation -- base directory

#All symbols needed to make GA/ARMCI

#As of now, some of the paths are hard-coded in the makefile.h files
# (e.g., boost). Change them as required.
