We now describe the semantics of languages in the \FX{} family.
We start with a core \FXZ{} language that supports simple
\FJ-like types, then add value-dependent types and type-dependent
types, separately, then finally add both. For uniformity we declare type-valued parameters and properties to be of ``type'' \type, instead of using square brackets to demarcate them.

\subsection{\FXZ}

The grammar for \FXZ{} is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:fx-grammar}.
The syntax is essentially that of \FJ{}.
Following the convention of \FJ{}, we use $\bar{x}$ to denote a
list $x_1, \dots, x_n$, and use $\bullet$ to denote the empty
list.

A program {\tt P} is a set of class declarations \tbar{L}.
Class names {\tt C} range over the declared classes in {\tt P} 
and {\tt Object}.
Classes have
properties (i.e., immutable fields) \tbar{f} and methods \tbar{M}.  We omit constructors
and require that the \new{} expression provide initializers
for all fields, including inherited fields. 
Methods are introduced with the {\tt def} keyword.

Both classes and methods may have constraint clauses
{\tt c}.  In the case of classes, {\tt c} is to be thought of as an
{\em invariant} satisfied by all instances of the class; in the case of
methods, {\tt c} is an additional condition, or {\em guard},
that must be satisfied by
the receiver 
and the actual arguments of the method in order for the method to
be applicable.

Expressions {\tt e} are either parameters {\tt x} (including the implicit
method parameter {\tt this}), field accesses, method invocations, \new{}
expressions, or casts (written {\tt e}~\as~{\tt T}).

The set of types includes classes {\tt C} and is closed under
constrained types ($\tt T\{c\}$) and existential
quantification ($\exists \tt x:T.~U$).
A value {\tt v} is of type {\tt C} if it is an instance of class {\tt C}; it is of type $\tt
T\{c\}$ if it is of type {\tt T} and it satisfies the constraint $\tt
c[v/self]$; it is of type $\exists \tt x:T.~U$
if there is some value {\tt w}
of type {\tt T} such that {\tt v} is of type
$\tt U[w/x]$.

The syntax for constraints in \FXZ{} is specified in
Figure~\ref{fig:fx-grammar}. As expected, constraints
relate property fields of objects. Neither casts
nor method invocations are permitted in constraints.

We distinguish a subset of these constraints as
{\em user constraints}---these are permitted to occur in
programs. For \FXZ{} the only user constraint permitted is the vacuous
{\tt true}. Thus the types occurring in user programs are isomorphic
to class types, and class and method definitions specialize to the
standard class and method definitions of \FJ{}. 

The constraints permitted by the syntax in
Figure~\ref{fig:fx-grammar} that
are not user constraints are used to define the static and
dynamic semantics of \FXZ{} (see, e.g., rule \TField{} in Figure~\ref{fig:FX}).
The use of this richer constraint set as well as constrained and existential types is
not necessary in \FXZ; it simply enables us to present the static and dynamic
semantics once for the entire family of \FX{} languages,
specifying the other members of the family as extensions
to these core semantics.

Existential constraints are introduced for convenience only:
${\tt T}\{\exists {\tt x}:{\tt U}.~{\tt c}\}$ is equivalent to $\exists {\tt y}:{\tt U}.~{\tt T}\{{\tt c}[{\tt y}/{\tt x}]\}$ choosing {\tt y} not free in {\tt T}.

\paragraph{Dynamic semantics.}
The operational semantics, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:sos},
is straightforward and essentially identical
to \FJ \cite{FJ}. It is described in terms of a non-deterministic
reduction relation on expressions.\eat{\footnote{
For simplicity, we enforce call-by-value-like semantics:
\RField, \RInvk, and \RCast{} require receivers of the form
``$\new~{\tt C}(\tbar{t})$'' instead of ``$\new~{\tt C}(\tbar{e})$''.
Otherwise, we would have to distinguish compile-time constraints over constraint terms from run-time constraints over expressions.}}

The only novelty is the use of the
subtyping relation to check that the cast is satisfied.
The typing rule for casts ({\sc T-New}) in Figure~\ref{fig:FX} specifies that if the arguments $\tbar{e}$ have type $\tbar{V}$ then $\new~{\tt C}(\tbar{e})$ has type $\exists\tbar{y}:\tbar{V}.~{\tt C}\{\self==\new~{\tt C}(\tbar{y})\}$, therefore {\RCast} requires this particular type to be a subtype of {\tt T}.
In \FXZ, this
test simply involves checking that the class of which the object is an
instance is a subclass of the class specified in the given type; in
languages with richer notions of type this operation may
involve run-time constraint solving using the properties of the object.
See Section~\ref{sec:casts} for further discussion of the casts,
including decidability issues.

\paragraph{Static Semantics.}
Each language in the family is defined over a given input constraint system $\mathcal{X}$ that is required to support the trivial constraint \true{}, conjunction, existential quantification, and equality on constraint terms. Given a program {\tt P}, we now show how to derive from $\mathcal{X}$ a larger deduction system that captures the object-oriented structure of {\tt P} and lets us decide whether {\tt P} is well typed.

In the following, the context $\Gamma$ is always a
(finite, possibly empty) sequence of formulas $\tt x:T$ and constraints $\tt c$ satisfying:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item for any formula $\phi=\tt x:T$ or constraint $\phi=\tt c$ in the sequence all free variables $\tt y$
  occurring in $\tt T$ or $\tt c$ are declared by a formula $\tt
  y:U$ in the sequence to the left of $\phi$.

  \item for any variable $\tt x$, there is at most one
  formula $\tt x:T$ in $\Gamma$.
\end{enumerate}

\medskip

In the judgments that follow, 
for any formulas $\phi_1$ and
$\phi_2$, we adopt the convention that the rule $\Gamma \vdash \phi_1,~\phi_2$
is shorthand for the rules
$\Gamma \vdash \phi_1$
and
$\Gamma \vdash \phi_2$. Whenever
we state an assumption of the form ``{\tt x} fresh'' in a rule we mean
it is not free in the consequent of the rule.

The judgments of interest are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Well-formedness:\\
	  $\cj{\Gamma}{\tt c}$ \hfill constraint {\tt c} is well formed\\
	  $\wj{\Gamma}{\tt T}$ \hfill  type {\tt T} is well formed
	\item Member lookup:\\
	  $\fields({\tt C})=\tbar{f}:\tbar{T}$ \hfill class {\tt C} has fields \tbar{f} of type \tbar{T}\\
	  $\Gamma\vdash {\tt C}~\has~{\tt I}$ \hfill class {\tt C} has member {\tt I}\\
	  $\Gamma\vdash {\tt x}~\underline\has~{\tt I}$ \hfill variable {\tt x} has member {\tt I}\\
	  $~$ \hfill where ${\tt I}::= {\tt f}:{\tt T} \alt {\tt m}(\tbar{x}:\tbar{T})\{{\tt c}\}:{\tt U}={\tt e}$
	\item Constraints:\\
	  $\Gamma\vdash {\tt c}$ \hfill constraint {\tt c} holds
	\item Typing:\\
	  $\Gamma\vdash {\tt e}:{\tt T}$ \hfill expression {\tt e} has type {\tt T}\\
	  $\vdash {\tt def}~{\tt m}(\tbar{x}:\tbar{T})\{{\tt c}\}:{\tt U}={\tt e}~{\rm OK~in}~{\tt C}$ \\ $~$ \hfill method {\tt m} in class {\tt C} type checks\\
	  $\vdash {\tt class}~{\tt C}(\tbar{f}:\tbar{T})\{{\tt c}\}~{\tt extends}~{\tt D}~\{~\tbar{M}~\}~{\rm OK}$ \\ $~$ \hfill class {\tt C} type checks
	\item Subtyping:\\
	  $\Gamma \vdash {\tt S} \subtype {\tt T}$ \hfill type {\tt S} is a subtype of type {\tt T}
\end{enumerate}

\medskip

A program type checks iff all its classes do.  We now describe
in more detail each of these judgments, in turn.

\paragraph{1. Well-formedness.} A constraint {\tt c} is well
formed in context $\Gamma$, written $\cj{\Gamma}{\tt c}$, iff
both
its free variables are declared in $\Gamma$ and it is well
formed for the underlying constraint system. The rules in Figure~\ref{fig:well} extend this requirement to types.

We say a program, context, or judgment is well formed iff all the constraints and types involved are well formed. By design, every judgment derived from a well-formed context is also well formed. As a consequence, if a program type checks, it is well formed.

\paragraph{2. Member lookup.} Figure~\ref{fig:lookup} specifies the fields and methods available on each class. We impose restrictions on inheritance as follows. Classes may only be extended by classes with stronger invariants. Fields cannot be overridden. Methods cannot be overloaded.
A method may only be overridden by a method with the same name,
arity, parameter types, a return type that is a subtype of the
overridden return type, and a weaker guard (i.e., the superclass
method guard must entail the subclass's).
\footnote{To avoid cluttering the inference rules, we
define overriding only informally; a formal definition is
straightforward.}

To prepare for the introduction of generic types later, we
distinguish members that are available on variables from members
available on classes.  For now,
${\tt x}:{\tt C}~\underline\has~{\tt I}[{\tt x}/\this]$ iff ${\tt C}~\has~{\tt I}$.

\paragraph{3. Constraints.}
In defining these judgments we will use \mbox{$\Gamma \vdashX {\tt c}$}, the judgment corresponding to the underlying constraint system. Formally, $\cal X$ permits judgments of the form $\Gamma \vdashX {\tt c}$ where $\Gamma::=\tbar{c}$ is a (finite, possibly empty) sequence of constraints. We define the {\em constraint
projection}, $\sigma(\Gamma)$ as follows.
%
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l}
$\sigma(\epsilon)={\tt true}$\\
$\sigma({\tt x}:{\tt C}, \Gamma)=\sigma(\Gamma)$\\
$\sigma({\tt x}:{\tt T\{c\}}, \Gamma)={\tt c}[{\tt x}/\self], \sigma({\tt x}:{\tt T},\Gamma)$\\
$\sigma({\tt x}:\exists {\tt y}:{\tt T}.~{\tt U}, \Gamma)=\sigma({\tt z:T}, {\tt x}:{\tt U[{\tt z}/{\tt y}]},\Gamma)$\\
$\sigma({\tt c},\Gamma) = {\tt c}, \sigma(\Gamma)$
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
%
Above, in the fourth rule, 
we assume that alpha-equivalence is used to
choose a variable {\tt z} that does not
occur in the context under construction.

We define $\Gamma\vdash {\tt c}$ in Figure~\ref{fig:object}. {\sc X-Sel} permits the underlying constraint system $\mathcal{X}$ to interpret field accesses. {\sc X-Inv} handles class invariants. Note the use of subtyping here to prepare for the introduction of bounds on generics types later.

We say that a context $\Gamma$ is {\em consistent} if all (finite)
subsets of $\{{\tt c}\alt \sigma(\Gamma) \vdash {\tt c}\}$ are consistent.
In all type judgments presented below ({\sc T-Cast}, {\sc T-Field},
etc.), we make the implicit assumption that the context $\Gamma$ is
consistent; if it is inconsistent, the rule cannot be used and the
type of the given expression cannot be established (type-checking
fails).

\eat{
The following rules govern existential constraints:
\infrule[Exists-R]
  {\Gamma\vdash {\tt t}:{\tt T} \andalso \Gamma\vdash{\tt c}[{\tt t}/{\tt x}]}
  {\Gamma\vdash \exists {\tt x}:{\tt T}.~{\tt c}}

\infrule[Exists-L]
  {\Gamma,{\tt x}:{\tt T},{\tt c}\vdash {\tt d} \andalso {\tt x}~\rm fresh}
  {\Gamma,\exists {\tt x}:{\tt T}.~{\tt c}\vdash {\tt d}}
}

\paragraph{4. Typing.} The typing rules are specified in Figure~\ref{fig:FX}.

{\sc T-Var} is as expected, except that it asserts the constraint {\tt
self==x}, which records that any value of this type is known
statically to be equal to {\tt x}. This constraint is actually very
crucial---as we shall see in the other rules, once we establish that
an expression {\tt e} is of a given type {\tt T}, we ``transfer'' the
type to a freshly chosen variable {\tt z}.  If, in fact, {\tt e} has a
static ``name'' {\tt x} (i.e., {\tt e} is known statically to be
equal to {\tt x}; that is, it has type {\tt T\{self==x\}}), then
{\sc T-Var} lets us assert that {\tt z:T\{self==x\}}, i.e., that {\tt z}
equals {\tt x}.
Thus {\sc T-Var} provides an important base case for
reasoning statically about equality of values in the environment.

We do away with the three cast rules in \FJ{} in favor of a single
cast rule, requiring only that {\tt e} be of some type {\tt U}.  At run time,
{\tt e} will be checked to see if it is actually of type {\tt T} (see
{\sc R-Cast} in Figure~\ref{fig:sos}).

{\sc T-Field} may be understood through ``proxy'' reasoning as
follows:  Given the context $\Gamma$, assume the receiver {\tt e} can
be established to be of type {\tt T}. Now, we do not know the run-time
value of {\tt e}, so we shall assume that it is some fixed but unknown
``proxy'' value {\tt x} (of type {\tt T}) that is ``fresh'' in that it
is not known to be related to any known value (i.e., those recorded
in $\Gamma$).  If we can establish that {\tt x} has a field {\tt f} of
type {\tt U}\footnote{Note from the definition of
\fields{} in Figure~\ref{fig:lookup} that all occurrences of
\this{} in the declared type of the field {\tt f} will have been replaced
by {\tt x}.}, then we can assert that
{\tt e.f} has type {\tt U} and, further, that it equals {\tt x.f}.
Hence, we can assert that {\tt e.f} has type 
$\exists {\tt x}:{\tt T}.~{\tt U}\{\self={\tt x}.{\tt f}\}$.

{\sc T-Invk} has a similar structure to {\sc T-Field}: we use
proxy reasoning for the receiver and the arguments of the method
call. {\sc T-New} also uses the same proxy reasoning: however in this case
we can establish that the resulting value is equal to $\new~{\tt C}(\tbar{y})$
for some values $\bar{\tt y}$ of the given types.

{\sc OK-Method} and {\sc OK-Class} ensure that the types and constraints occurring in a program are well formed. Following from \FJ{}, these rules do not preclude the existence of cycles in the type declarations. We assume they are acyclic. {\sc OK-Method} checks that the actual type {\tt W} of the method body {\tt e} is a subtype of its declared return type {\tt V}. {\sc OK-Class} makes sure all methods of the class type check.


\paragraph{5. Subtyping.} The subtyping relation is defined in Figure~\ref{fig:subtyping}.
Unsurprisingly, it is reflexive ({\sc S-Refl}) and transitive ({\sc S-Trans}).
{\sc S-Exists-L} and {\sc S-Exists-R} handle existential types.
{\sc S-Const-L} and {\sc S-Const-R} handle constraints. The rules ensure all types are well formed.

\subsection{\FXD}

Turning \FXZ{} into a language with value-dependent types is straightforward
since the construction of the previous section is parametric in the underlying constraint system $\mathcal{X}$, and constraint propagation is already built into the typing rules.

First, we assume we are given a constraint system $\cal A$ with a vocabulary of primitive types ${\tt A}$,
predicates ${\tt p}$, functions ${\tt q}$, and literals ${\tt l}$.

Second, we extend the productions of \FXZ{} as follows.
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{r@{\quad}rcl}
  (Type)& {\tt T} &{::=}& {\tt A} \\
  (Expression) & {\tt e} &{::=}& ${\tt q}(\tbar{e})$ \\
  (Values) & {\tt v} &{::=}& ${\tt l}$ \\
  (Constraint term) & {\tt t} &{::=}& ${\tt q}(\tbar{t})$ \\
  (Constraint) & {\tt c} &{::=}& ${\tt p}(\tbar{t})$ \\  
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The following rules are needed to type functions and literals:

\infrule[T-Fun]
	{{\tt q}{\rm~has~type~\tbar{A} \rightarrow {\tt B}{\rm~in~}\mathcal{A}} \andalso \Gamma\vdash\tbar{e}:\tbar{A}} 
	{\Gamma\vdash{{\tt q}(\tbar{e}):\exists\tbar{x}:\tbar{A}.~{\tt B}\{\self=={\tt q}(\tbar{x})\}}}

\infrule[T-Lit]
	{{\tt l}{\rm~has~type~{\tt A} {\rm~in~}\mathcal{A}}} 
	{\Gamma\vdash{{\tt l}:{\tt A}\{\self=={\tt l}\}}}

We extend the operational semantics with rules:
\infrule[RC-Fun]
	{{\tt e}_i\derives {\tt e}'_i}
	{{\tt q}(\ldots,{\tt e}_i,\ldots)\derives {\tt q}(\ldots,{\tt e}'_i,\ldots)}

\infrule[R-Fun]
	{{\tt q}{\rm~has~type~\tbar{A} \rightarrow {\tt B}{\rm~in~}\mathcal{A}} \andalso \Gamma\vdash\tbar{v}:\tbar{A}} 
	{{\tt q}(\tbar{v})\derives \SB{{\tt q}(\tbar{v})}}
where $\SB{{\tt q}(\tbar{v})}$ denotes the result of the evaluation of function {\tt q} on values \tbar{v}.

Finally, we permit users to write constraints in $\cal A$ (except for existential constraints) in programs.
%
For instance, if $\mathcal{A}$ defines the type {\tt int}, integer literals, and the usual arithmetic operators, then we can declare:

\begin{xten}
class Count(n:int) extends Object {
  def inc():Count{self.n==this.n+1} =
  	new Count(this.n+1);
}
\end{xten}

In practice, it makes sense to distinguish the functions of the
constraint language from the functions of the base language.
One would define the {\sc T-Fun} typing judgment on a case-by-case
basis to
relate the interpretation of \xcd"q" as an expression to
its interpretation as a constraint term.

\FXD corresponds to the \CFJ calculus presented
in our prior work on constrained types~\cite{constrained-types}.  As described there, \Xten
supports equality constraints and has been extended with constraint
systems for Presburger arithmetic and for set constraints over
\Xten's array index domains (viz., regions).

\subsection{\FXG}
We now turn to showing how \FGJ{}-style generics can be supported in the \FX{} family.
\FXG{} is the language obtained by adding to \FXZ{} the
following productions:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{r@{\quad}rcl}
  (Expression)& {\tt e} &{::=}& ${\tt C}\{{\tt c}\}$ \\
  (Value)& {\tt v} &{::=}& ${\tt C}\{{\tt c}\}$ \\
  (Path)& {\tt p} &{::=}& ${\tt x}$ \alt {\tt p}.{\tt f} \\
  (Type)& {\tt T} &{::=}& ${\tt p}$ \alt \type \\
  (Constraint term)& {\tt t} &{::=}& ${\tt T}$ \\
  (Constraint) & {\tt c} &{::=}& ${\tt T}\extends {\tt T}$
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\noindent
and deduction rules of Figure~\ref{fig:FXG}.

First we introduce the ``type'' \type. \FGJ{} method type
parameters are modeled in \FXG{} as normal parameters of type
\type.\footnote{In concrete \Xten{} syntax type parameters are
distinguished from ordinary value parameters through the use of
``square'' brackets. This is particularly useful in implementing type
inference for generic parameters. We abstract these concerns away in
the abstract syntax presented in this section.}  Generic class
parameters are modeled as ordinary fields of type \type, with
parameter bound information recorded as a constraint in the class
invariant. This decision to use fields rather than parameters is
discussed further in Section~\ref{sec:parameters-vs-fields}. In brief,
it permits powerful idioms using fixed but unknown types without
requiring ``wildcards''.

The set of well-formed types is now enhanced to permit some fixed but unknown
types {\tt x} as well as \emph{path types} (cf. \cite{scala}),
i.e., type-valued fields of objects as types.\footnote{But we will not permit invocations of methods with return type \type\ to be 
used as types. This does indeed make sense, but developing
this theory further is beyond the scope of this paper.} We extend $\sigma$ in the obvious way:
%
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l}
$	\sigma({\tt x}:\type, \Gamma)=\sigma(\Gamma)$\\
$\sigma({\tt x}:{\tt y}, \Gamma)=\sigma(\Gamma)$\\
$\sigma({\tt x}:{\tt p}.{\tt f}, \Gamma)=\sigma(\Gamma)$
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
%
Reciprocally, we permit class types ${\tt C}\{{\tt c}\}$ to be
used as expressions. We type them accordingly ({\sc T-Type}). In
contrast, the ``type'' \type{} is neither a valid expression nor
a class type: it has no field, method, subclass, or superclass.
It may however be constrained as usual as, for instance, in rule
{\sc T-Type}; that is to say, we permit equality constraints over types.\footnote{Type equality is just equality over uninterpreted functions.}

The key idea is that information about type-valued expressions can
be accumulated through constraints. Specifically we introduce 
the ``extends'' constraint ${\tt T}\extends{\tt U}$. It may be used, for
instance, to specify upper bounds on type variables or fields (path
types). In \FXG{}, users are permitted to specify ``$==$'' and ``$\extends$'' constraints
about type variables, fields, and class types.

\begin{example}
The \FGJ{} parametric method

\begin{xten} 
<T> T id(T x) { return x; }
\end{xten}
\noindent can be represented as
\begin{xten} 
def id(T: type, x: T): T = x;
\end{xten}
\end{example}

\begin{example}
\noindent The \FGJ{} class 
\begin{xten} 
class Comparator<B> {
  int compare(B y) { ... } }
class SortedList<T extends Comparator<T>> { 
  int m(T x, T y) { return x.compare(y); } }
\end{xten}
\noindent can be represented as
\begin{xtenmath} 
class Comparator(B: type) {
  def compare(y:B):int = ...; }
class SortedList(T: type)
    {T $\extends$ Comparator{self.B==T}} { 
  def m(x:T, y:T):int = x.compare(y); }
\end{xtenmath}
\end{example}

We require the underlying constraint system $\mathcal{G}$ to treat ``$\extends$'' as a partial order relation (reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive). It is possible for a program to specify constraints incompatible with the class hierarchy, e.g., ${\tt x}\extends{\tt C}$ and ${\tt x}\extends{\tt D}$ if both class {\tt C} and class {\tt D} extend {\tt Object}. We therefore require $\mathcal{G}$ to treat as inconsistent all sets of constraints on type-valued variables that admit no valuations where these variables take on types as values.

The ``$\extends$'' constraint is used in two deduction rules. If
type {\tt T} extends type {\tt U}, then
\begin{itemize}
\item{\sc S-Extends}. {\tt T} is a subtype of {\tt U}. A method or constructor with argument type {\tt U} may be passed a parameter of type {\tt T}.
\item{\sc L-Extends}. If {\tt x} has type {\tt U} then {\tt x} has all the members of type {\tt T}. Note we only extend the ``$\underline\has$'' predicate that is used in typing judgments. On the other hand, the ``$\has$'' predicate used for method lookup in the operational semantics is not affected.
\end{itemize}

The modification of the lookup predicate is
necessary to permit typing method invocations with receivers of
generic types. It has the unfortunate side effect that we can no
longer ensure that type derivations---and hence types---are unique.
For instance, given the class definitions:
%
\begin{xten}
class A() extends Object { def m():A = new A(); }
class B() extends A { def m():B new B(); }
class C(f:type){this.f<=A} extends Object {}
class D(){this.f<=B} extends C { ..this.f.m().. }
\end{xten}
%
occurrences of $\this.{\tt f}$ in {\tt D} are bounded both by {\tt A} and {\tt B} hence 
$\this.{\tt f}.{\tt m}()$ may either be typed using the declaration of {\tt m} in {\tt A} or {\tt B}.

Another property of \FXG{} worth noticing is that casts can ``erase'' typing information.
Consider the program:
\begin{xten}
class C() extends Object {}
class D(f:type, g:this.f) extends Object {}
\end{xten}
Class {\tt D} has a type parameter {\tt f} and a value field {\tt g} of type {\tt f}.
Thanks to constraints, if
${\tt e}=\new~{\tt D}({\tt C},\new~{\tt C}())$,
then expression ${\tt e}.{\tt g}$ can be shown to
have type {\tt C}.
In contrast $({\tt e}~\as~{\tt D}).{\tt g}$ has type
$\exists {\tt x}:{\tt D}.{\tt x}.{\tt f}\{\self=={\tt x.g}\}$.
The type of $({\tt e}~\as~{\tt D}).{\tt g}$ is essentially ``unknown''
because the cast erased all information about it. In \Xten, we choose to shield users from existential types and only permit casts of the form $({\tt e}~\as~{\tt D}\{\self.{\tt f}=={\tt t}\})$ where {\tt t} is a type in scope (class type, type parameter, or path type).


\subsection{\FXGD} 

No additional rules are needed beyond those of \FXG{} and \FXD{}. This
language permits type and value constraints, supporting \FGJ{} style
generics and value-dependent types. All constraints but existential constraints are now user constraints.

\subsection{Results}
The following results hold for \FXGD supposing the program {\tt P} type checks.

\begin{theorem}[Subject Reduction] If $\Gamma$ is well formed and $\Gamma \vdash {\tt e:T}$ and ${\tt e} \derives {\tt e'}$, then
for some type {\tt S}, $\Gamma \vdash {\tt {\tt e}':{\tt S}},~{\tt S} \subtype {\tt T}$.
\end{theorem}

Values are of the form $\tt v ::= \new\ C(\bar{\tt v}) \alt {\tt l} \alt C\{c\}$.

\begin{theorem}[Progress]
If $\vdash {\tt e:T}$ then one of the following conditions holds:
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\tt e} is a value,
\item {\tt e} contains a cast sub-expression that is stuck,
\item there exists an $\tt e'$ s.t. $\tt e\derives e'$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Type soundness]
If $\vdash {\tt e:T}$ and {\tt e}
reduces to a normal form ${\tt e'}$, then
either $\tt e'$ is a value {\tt v} and $\vdash {\tt v:S},{\tt S\subtype T}$ or
${\tt e'}$ contains  a stuck cast sub-expression.
\end{theorem}

\paragraph{Proof sketch.} The proof of the same results for a
formal language essentially equivalent to \FXD{} has been
reported in \cite{constrained-types}. We discuss here the key
insights that permit us to revise this proof in order to encompass \FXGD{}.
\begin{itemize}
\item Subject reduction. Having potentially multiple types for
an expression does not make the proof any harder as the subject
reduction theorem lets us choose {\tt S} among the possible types of ${\tt e}'$.

The main novelty of the \FXG{} type system is that it permits
the $\underline\has$ predicate to look for methods in arbitrary
superclasses or upper bounds of the type under scrutiny. This is
not so much a concern for fields as they cannot be overridden.
Because methods can, we must adapt the proof of subject reduction for the execution step corresponding to a method invocation (\RInvk).

First, we observe that the operational semantics rule for method
invocations (\RInvk) is required to employ the ``correct''
method for objects of class {\tt C}, that is, the first method
{\tt m} found on the inheritance path from class {\tt C} to
class {\tt Object} from the bottom up. Second, thanks
to overriding restrictions, we know that this method must have a
return type that is a subtype of any other method {\tt m}
defined in any superclass of {\tt C}. Finally, because
constraint sets incompatible with the class hierarchy are
inconsistent, we also know that the type of
$\new~{\tt C}(\tbar{e})$ cannot be constrained to have any upper
bound that is not {\tt C} itself or one of its superclasses.

We
therefore derive that any method instance one could use to type
the expression $\new~{\tt C}(\tbar{e}).{\tt m}(\tbar{a})$ has a
return type that is a supertype of the return type of the only
method instance that can be used to make a step of execution. We
assume the program type checks; hence, by {\sc OK-Method}, we
know that the actual residue ${\tt b}[\new~{\tt C}(\tbar{e}),\tbar{a}/\this,\tbar{x}]$ is guaranteed to have a
type that is a subtype of its declared type. Therefore, by
transitivity of the subtyping relation, we can derive that if
{\tt T} is a type of $\new~{\tt C}(\tbar{e}).{\tt m}(\tbar{a})$,
then there exists a type {\tt S} of
${\tt b}[\new~{\tt C}(\tbar{e}),\tbar{a}/\this,\tbar{x}]$
that is a subtype of {\tt T}.

\item Progress. \FXGD{} only differs from \FXD{} in that it
admits a new kind of expressions: {\tt C}\{{\tt c}\}. But these are also values, so the proof of progress is essentially unchanged.
\eat{
 {\tt l} ~$|$~ {\tt q}(\tbar{e}) ~$|$~ {\tt C}\{{\tt c}\}.
Both literals and class types are values, we just have to establish progress in the case of function calls (in the context of a proof by induction on the structure of the expression {\tt e}).
Assume ${\tt q}(tbar{e})$ is well typed then if all \tbar{e} are values progress is possible by rule {\sc R-Fun}. If not, then at leat one of the expressions is not a value and by induction hypothesis applied to this expression we can conclude that it is either stuck on a cast or can make a step of execution step. We conclude using rule {\sc RC-Fun} in the second case.}
\item{Type soundness}. Direct consequence of the previous two theorems.
\end{itemize}



\eat{We proceed by induction on the last rule used in the proof of ${\tt e} \derives {\tt e'}$. The key case is {\sc R-Invk}. Because of rule 


\begin{itemize}
\item {\sc RC-Field}. If $\Gamma\vdash S<:T$ then the fields of $T$ are the first fields of $S$.
\item {\sc RC-Invk-Recv}. If $\Gamma\vdash S<:T$ and $\Gamma,x:T\vdash x~\underline\has~m(y:U)\{c\}:V=a$ then there exists $d$ and $W$ such that $\Gamma,x:S\vdash x~\underline\has~m(y:U)\{d\}:W=b$ and $d$ entails $c$ and $W<:V$.
\item {\sc RC-Cast}. Straightforward.
\item {\sc RC-New-Arg}. If $\Gamma\vdash S<:T$ then $\exists x:T.U<:\exists x:S.U$.
\item {\sc RC-Invk-Arg}. Same.
\item {\sc R-Invk}. If $\Gamma,x:C\vdash x~\has~m(y:U)\{c\}:V=a$ then for all $d$ and $W$ such that $\Gamma,x:C\vdash x~\underline\has~m(y:U)\{d\}:W=b$ it is the case that $c$ entails $d$ and $V<:W$.
\item {\sc R-Field}. We have $\Gamma\vdash t:V$ for some $V$, $\Gamma\vdash \new~C(t).f_i:W_i\{\exists x:(\exists y:V.C\{\self==\new~C(y)\}).\self==x.f_i\}$ where $\Gamma\vdash C~\has~f_i:W_i$. We prove $\Gamma\vdash V_i<:W_i\{\exists x:(\exists y:V.C\{\self==\new~C(y)\}).\self==x.f_i\}$.
\item {\sc R-Cast}. Straightforward.
\end{itemize}
}
