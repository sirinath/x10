\subsection*{Language changes}
\label{differences}

This section enumerates the changes that have been made to Scheme since
the ``Revised$^3$ report''~\cite{R3RS} was published.


\begin{itemize}
\item Although implementations may extend Scheme, they must offer
a syntactic mode that adds no reserved words and preempts no lexical conventions
of Scheme.

\item Implementations may report violations of
implementation restrictions.

\item It is no longer specified whether the empty list counts as true
or as false in conditional expressions.  It should be noted that the
IEEE standard for Scheme requires the empty list to count as true
\cite{IEEEScheme}.

\item The sets defined by \ide{boolean?}, \ide{pair?}, \ide{symbol?},
\ide{number?}, \ide{char?}, \ide{string?}, \ide{vector?}, and \ide{procedure?}
are required to be disjoint.

\item The variables bound by a \ide{lambda}, \ide{let}, \ide{letrec},
and \ide{do} must not contain duplicates.

\item Nested \ide{begin} expressions containing definitions are treated
as a sequence of definitions.

\item The \ide{eqv?} procedure is no longer required to be true of any
two empty strings or two empty vectors.

\item The syntax of numerical constants has been changed, and the exactness
implied by each syntax has been specified.

\item The semantics of many numerical procedures have been clarified.

\item \ide{Rationalize} has been restricted to two arguments and its
specification clarified.

\item The \ide{number->string} and \ide{string->number} procedures
have been changed.

\item \ide{Integer->char} now requires an exact integer argument.

\item The specification of the \ide{force} procedure has been
weakened.  The previous specification was unimplementable.

\item Variables removed: \ide{t}, \ide{nil}.

\item Procedures removed: \ide{approximate}, \ide{last-pair}.

\item Procedures added: \ide{list?}, \ide{peek-char}.

\item Syntaxes made essential: \ide{case}, \ide{and}, \ide{or},
\ide{quasiquote}.

\item Procedures made essential:
\end{itemize}                     % so the next block isn't indented

\begin{scheme}
reverse        char-ci=?        make-string
max            char-ci<?        string-set!
min            char-ci>?        string-ci=?
modulo         char-ci<=?       string-ci<?
gcd            char-ci>=?       string-ci>?
lcm            char-alphabetic? string-ci<=?
floor          char-numeric?    string-ci>=?
ceiling        char-whitespace? string-append
truncate       char-lower-case? open-input-file
round          char-upper-case? open-output-file
number->string char-upcase      close-input-port
string->number char-downcase    close-output-port
\end{scheme}

\begin{itemize}                   % continue with the last item
\item Procedures required to accept more general numbers of arguments:
\ide{append}, \ide{+}, \ide{*}, \ide{-} (one argument), \ide{/} (one
argument), \ide{=}, \ide{<}, \ide{>}, \ide{<=}, \ide{>=}, \ide{map},
\ide{for-each}.

\item A macro facility has been added as an appendix to this report.

\todo{
\item {\tt Call-with-input-file} and {\tt call-with-output-file} renamed
to \ide{call-with-input-port} and \ide{call-with-output-port}

\subsection*{Comparison with the dialect used in~\cite{SICP}}
Compare with S\&ICP: simple renamings like {\tt print}; easily
implemented things like {\tt cons-stream}; more grave and controversial
omissions like {\tt eval} and {\tt make-envi\-ron\-ment}.}

% I think the comparison with S&ICP is no longer so important.
% A comparison with IEEE Scheme might now be in order, though.

%\subsection*{Keywords as variable names}
%
%Some implementations allow arbitrary syntactic
%keywords \index{keyword}\index{syntactic keyword}to be used as variable
%names, instead of reserving them, as this report would have
%it.\index{variable} But this creates ambiguities in the interpretation
%of expressions: for example, in the following, it's not clear whether
%the expression {\tt (if 1 2 3)} should be treated as a procedure call or
%as a conditional.
%
%\begin{scheme}
%(define if list)
%(if 1 2 3)    \ev  2 {\em{}or} (1 2 3)%
%\end{scheme}
%
%These ambiguities are usually resolved in some consistent way within any
%given implementation, but no particular treatment stands out as being
%clearly superior to any other, so these situations were excluded for the
%purposes of this report.

%%R4%%
%\subsection*{Macros}
%
%Scheme does not have any standard facility for defining new kinds of
%expressions.\index{macros}
%
%\vest The ability to alter the syntax of the language creates
%numerous problems.  All current implementations of Scheme have macro
%facilities that solve those problems to one degree or another, but the
%solutions are quite different and it isn't clear at this time which
%solution is best, or indeed whether any of the solutions are truly
%adequate.  Rather than standardize, we are encouraging implementations
%to continue to experiment with different solutions.
%
%\vest The main problems with traditional macros are: They must be
%defined to the system before any code using them is loaded; this is a
%common source of obscure bugs.  They are usually global; macros can be
%made to follow lexical scope rules \todo{flushed: ``as in Common
%Lisp's {\tt macrolet}''; OK?}, but many people find the resulting scope rules
%confusing.  Unless they are written very carefully, macros are
%vulnerable to inadvertant capture of free variables; to get around this,
%for example, macros may have to generate code in which procedure values
%appear as quoted constants.  There is a similar problem with syntactic
%keywords if the keywords of special forms are not reserved.  If keywords
%are reserved, then either macros introduce new reserved words,
%invalidating old code, or else special forms defined by the programmer
%do not have the same status as special forms defined by the system.
%
%\todo{Refer to Pitman's special forms paper.}
%\todo{Pitman sez: Discuss importance of having a small number of special forms
%so that programs can inspect each other.}

\todo{Move cwcc history back here? --- Andy Cromarty is concerned about
confusion over who the audience is.}

\todo{Cromarty:
23. NOTES, p.35ff.: This material should stay somehow.  We need to
    make it clear that R$^3$ Scheme is not being touted as Yet Another
    Ultimate Solution To The Programming Language Problem, but rather
    as a snapshot of a *process* of good design, for which not all
    answers have yet been found.  We also ought to use the opportunity
    for publicity afforded us by SIGPLAN to advertise some of the thorny
    unsolved problems that need further research, and encourage
    language designers to work on them.}
