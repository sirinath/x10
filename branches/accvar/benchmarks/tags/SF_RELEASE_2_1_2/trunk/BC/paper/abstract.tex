\begin{abstract}
Betweenness centrality is an important measure of power of nodes in network
structures (roads, social networks, etc). The state-of-the-art implementations
that I could find in literature have not yet scaled to over a 1000 nodes.
Also, there is a clear lack of good distributed memory implementations.
