The project "x10.compiler" contains a directory "src" that
contains a package "x10.paser". To rebuild the parser, highlight
(left-mouse click) the file "x10.g" in x10.parser; go to the external
tools menu (the green button located next to the Run menu with the red
tool box next to it) and from its drop-down menu, select "lpg" and 
left-mouse click on it. Note that for now, this only works on Windows.

Located in x10.parser are 6 grammar files:

        GJavaParserForX10.gi  -- The base Generic Java grammar with some changes.
        x10.g                 -- Extra x10 rules and some altered Java rules

        GJavaLexer.gi         -- The base Lexer for Generic Java
        x10Lexer.gi           -- The extensions required for x10
        
        GJavaKWLexer.gi       -- Definition of Generic Java keywords
        x10KWLexer.gi         -- Definition of extra x10 keywords
