//LIMITATION:
//This test case will not meet expectations. It is a limitation of the current release.
/**
 * Language clarification needed.
 * Methods whose parameter types are only distinguished by whether they are
 * nullable end up with the same Java signature after erasing the nullable
 * attribute.
 *
 * Ideally we should produce a meaningful compile-time error here, along the
 * lines of what Java does for generics.
 * Alternatively, we can implement a C++-style name mangling scheme to
 * help distinguish those cases.
