BFS Random Altair
-- XWS is marginally better than SpanT at p=8 for V=10M
   **Dont know about Cilk.***

BFS Random Moxie

-- XWS outperforms Cilk at 1M (at 10M Cilk is marginally better?).
-- XWS outperforms SpanT.

BFS K Moxie

-- XWS outperforms Cilk at 1M, 10M
-- XWS comparable to SpanT at 1M, 10M

BFS Torus Moxie **5M data point would be good**

-- XWS outperforms Cilk at 10M for p>4. But not at 1M. 
-- XWS outperforms C at p=16,32 for 1M,10M


BFS K Graph Moxie
-- XWS outperforms Cilk at 1M. ***Worse at 10M***
-- ***XWS significant underperforms C at 1M and at 10M***
