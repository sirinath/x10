\section{Conclusion}\label{s:concl}

In this paper we have shown how several graph algorithms can be
expressed concisely and elegantly in \Xten. These algorithms rely
heavily on support for fine-grained concurrency. The \Xten{} runtime
(\XWS) implements fine-grained concurrency through an ehanced
work-stealing scheduler. Specifically the scheduler supports
improperly nested tasks, detection of global termination, and phased
work-stealing.  We measure the performance of spanning tree algorithms
implemented with pseudo-depth-first search (DFS), breadth-first search
(BFS) and a Shiloach-Vishkin algorithm on two multicore systems. We
show that the \XWS{} programs scale and exhibit performance comparable
with hand-written C programs.
