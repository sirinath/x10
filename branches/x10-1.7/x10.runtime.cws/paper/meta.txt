Techniques

(I) Allocate frames on the stack. Fib
(II) Use global termination detection. DFS
(III) Use global termination detection with area-specific counter. NQueens
(III) Use global quiescence detection. BFS
(IV) Use area-specific data-structures. LU

Other ideas

-- (Guojing) Use sloppy tasks. It is ok to execute a task multiple times. 
   You can use faster mechanism for work-stealing, dont have to do Dekker.

--(Guojing) Copy multiple tasks at a time.
