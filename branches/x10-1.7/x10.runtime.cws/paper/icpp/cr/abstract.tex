Solving large, irregular graph problems efficiently is
challenging. Current software systems and commodity multiprocessors do
not support fine-grained, irregular parallelism well. We present
\XWS{}, the \Xten{} Work Stealing framework, an open-source runtime
for the parallel programming language \Xten{} and a library to be used
directly by application writers. \XWS{} extends the Cilk work-stealing
framework with several features necessary to efficiently implement
graph algorithms, viz., support for improperly nested procedures,
%worker-specific data-structures, 
global termination detection, and
phased computation. We also present a strategy to adaptively control
the granularity of parallel tasks in the work-stealing scheme,
depending on the instantaneous size of the work queue. We compare the
performance of the \XWS{} implementations of spanning tree algorithms
with that of the hand-written C and Cilk implementations using various
graph inputs. We show that \XWS{} programs (written in Java) scale
and exhibit comparable or better performance.
