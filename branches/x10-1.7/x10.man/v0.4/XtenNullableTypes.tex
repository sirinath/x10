\paragraph{Nullable data type constructor.}
The {\em nullary type constructor} (\S~\ref{NullableTypeConstructor})
takes as argument a base data type and returns a new data type which
has the same values as the original one and a value denoted by the
literal {\cf null}, in case it did not already have this value.

\begin{x10}
{\em NullaryDataType ::}
   nullable \em{BaseDataType}
\end{x10}

This type constructor may be applied to value or reference, scalar or
array types.

The type {\tt nullable C} has the same visibility as the type {\tt
C}. It is always top-level (i.e., not nested and not inner). It has
the same members as {\tt C}. It implements the same interfaces as {\tt
C} along with the interface {\tt x10.lang.Nullable}.

The type {\tt nullable C} can be implicitly cast to the type {\tt T}
only if {\tt T} is equal to a type {\tt nullable D} and {\tt C} can be
implicitly cast to {\tt D}.
