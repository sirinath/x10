{}\XtenCurrVer{} interfaces are essentially the same \java{}
interfaces \cite[\S 9]{jls2}. An interface primarily specifies
signatures for public methods. It may extend multiple interfaces. 
%The
%need for magic constants in interfaces is lessened with the
%introduction of {\tt enum} (\S~\ref{XtenEnums}).

An interface method taking a single argument of type {\tt T} and
returning a value of {\tt T} may be marked with the qualifier {\tt
reduction}. This indicates that the method is associative and
commutative, and may hence be used in reduction/scanning operations on
arrays of {\tt T} (\S~\ref{ArrayReductions}).\index{operator!reduction}\label{ReductionOperator}

Future version of \Xten{} will introduce additional structure in
interface definitions that will allow the programmer to state
additional properties of classes that implement that interface. For
instance a method may be declared {\tt pure} to indicate that its
evaluation cannot have any side-effects. A method may be declared {\tt
local} to indicate that its execution is confined purely to the
current place (no communication with other places). Similarly,
behavioral properties of the method as they relate to the usage of
clocks of the current activity may be specified.
