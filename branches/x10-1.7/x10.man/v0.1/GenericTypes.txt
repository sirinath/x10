'''Examples'''

The uniform treatment of value and reference types results in some simple programs. Consider for instance the code for a memoization program, such as a frequency count. This may be written in X10 as:

----
 public class Freq {   
  public static void main(String[] args) {      
    Map<String, int> m = new TreeMap<String, int>();      
      for (String word : args) {          
         m.put(word, m.get(word)+1);
      }      
    System.out.println(m);   
  }
 }
----

----
 public class Map<Dom, Range> {
 

 }
The code for '''Map.get(word)''' returns the value returned by invoking the nullary constructor on its second type argument (in this case, '''int''') when
