/**
 * Implementation of Clock.  Technically the spec says that this is
 * a value class, but of course the implementation of clocks needs to
 * keep mutable state (somewhere).  Clocks are also integrated with the
 * Runtime and with places since they need to interact with activity
 * creation.  
 
 * 
 <p>Let each activity A track the phase of every clock c it is registered
 with, call this variable A_C. 
 
 <p>Let each clock c track its phase, call it Cp. 
 
 <p>A clock is said to be in whole phase if A_C = Cp for every activity A. 
 
 <p>It is in split phase if A_C = Cp-1 for some activities, and A_C = Cp
 for some others.
 
 <p>In the algorithm we dont actually need to track Cp and A_C, though it
 is helpful to think as if we are.
 
 <p>The clock tracks three sets of activities: activities_, resumed_, and
 nextResumed_. The clock also has a boolean variable, splitPhase, which
 is initialy false.
 
 <p>Initially the clock starts out in whole phase (splitPhase=false).
 
 <p>We will assume that activities always do a resume before doing a next. 
 
 <p>Say that an activity A in activities_ is 
 <ul>
 <li> activeNow: clock is in wholephase, A is not in resumed_.
 <li> quiescedNow: A is in resumed_.
 <li> activeNext: clock is in splitphase, A is not in resumed_ || nextResumed_.
 <li> quiescedNext: A is in nextResumed_.
 
 <li> active: activeNow or activeNext
 <li>quiesced: quiescedNow or quiescedNext
 <li> registered: active or quiesced
 <li> unregistered: not in activities_, resumed_ or nextResumed_
 </ul>
 
 <p>Invariants on the state of the sytems:
 <ul>
 <li>  (1) A clock is either in splitPhase or wholePhase.
 <li>  (2) activity_ superset resumed_ u nextResumed_
 <li>  (3) nextResumed_ and resumed_ are disjoint
 <li>  (4) In wholePhase, nextResumed_ = empty.
 <li>  (5) Whenever next is performed by an activity, activity is quiesced.
 <li>  (6) An activity is either active or quiesced.
 </ul>
 
 <P>Transition from wholePhase to splitPhase: when |activity_| = |resumed_|
 <p>Transition from splitPhase to wholePhase: when |resumed_| = 0
 
 <p>When an activity does a resume:
 <ul>
 <li>unregistered -> throw CUE
 <li>quiescedNow -> quiescedNow, return.    
 <li>quiescedNext -> quiescedNext, return.
 <li>activeNow -> quiescedNow, tryMoveToSplit, return.
 <li>activeNext -> quiescedNext, return.
 </ul>
 
 <p>When an activity does a next: {assumed to be quiesced by (5)}
 <ul>
 <li>unregistered -> throw CUE
 <li>quiescedNow, splitPhase -> activeNext, tryMoveToWhole, return.
 <li>quiescedNow, wholePhase -> block until splitPhase, move to activeNow on wakeup.
 <li> quiescedNext, splitPhase -> block until next splitPhase, move to activeNow on wakeup
 <li> quiescedNext, wholePhase : impossible start state by (4).
 </ul>
 
 <p>When an activity terminates:
 <ul>
 <li> unregistered -> throw CUE
 <li> registered -> unregistered, tryMoveToSplit, return.
 </ul>
 
 <p>When an activity B spawns another A, giving it the clock c:
 <ul>
 <li> B quiesced  -> throw CUE
 <li> B unregistered -> throw CUE
 <li> A unregistered -> A registered, return.
 </ul>
 
 <p>tryMoveToSplit: 
 If |activities_| == |resumed_|, move clock to splitPhase, wake up all
 suspended activities.
 
 <p>tryMoveToWhole:
 If |resumed_| == 0, move clock to wholePhase, move nextResumed_ to resumed_,
 set nextResumed_ to empty. {This causes all activities in quiescedNext state
 to move to the quiescedNow state.}
