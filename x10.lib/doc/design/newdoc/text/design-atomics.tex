\subsection{Atomic Sections}

\paragraph{Implementation of atomic operations}
{}\Xtenlib{} provides special kind of objects, {\em monitored} objects
(e.g.{} futures). Each monitored object is a normal \Xten{} object
together with a data-structure (the suspension queue) for recording
the activities that are suspended on this datum, waiting for it to
change state. Writes to fields of monitored objects result in the
suspension queue being examined. The suspension predicate for each
async in the queue is evaluated, if it is true the async is moved from
the suspension queue to the async queue associated with the place.
