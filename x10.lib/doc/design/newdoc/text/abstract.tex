\begin{abstract}
	{}\Xtenlib{} is a runtime system for \Xten{}, designed for
	tightly-coupled clusters of multiprocessors. It supports a partitioned
	global address space, multiple places, global datastructures (arrays),
	and dynamically spawned activities and synchronization operations
	between these activities. The library is intended for use by the
	\Xten{} compiler as a runtime library, and also by programmers in
	C/C++ wishing to write code in the \Xten{} style.

	This document presents a snapshot of the high-level design of
	\Xtenlib{}. A companion note will document the actual APIs exported by
	\Xtenlib. This document will be kept uptodate on the \Xten{} website,
	{\tt x10.sf.net}.
