	\Xtenlib{} is a library that provides a runtime system for the
	\Xten{} programming language. \Xtenlib{} is designed for
	clusters of multi-processors equipped with high-speed
	interconnects.  \Xtenlib{} provides partitioned global address
	space (PGAS), supports execution on multiple places, global
	arrays, dynamically spawned activities and their
	synchronization. The library is intended to be a target of the
	\Xten{} compiler, however, programmers using C/C++ can also
	utilize this library to experiment writing code using \Xten{}
	constructs. This document presents a high-level design
	description of \Xtenlib{}. 
	
	%{}\Xtenlib{} is a runtime system for \Xten{}, designed for
	%tightly-coupled clusters of multiprocessors. It supports a partitioned
	%global address space, multiple places, global datastructures (arrays),
	%and dynamically spawned activities and synchronization operations
