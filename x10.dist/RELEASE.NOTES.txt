Release 1.7.7

This release includes both the C++ and Java code generation backends.

There were no language changes since the 1.7.6 release of X10.

The following features described in the 1.7 language manual do not
currently work with the Java backend and will be fixed in the subsequent
releases:

- Type parameters on closures
- Non-static type definitions as class or interface members
  (static type defs do work)
- Type definitions as package members (i.e., in the outermost scope of
  a compilation unit)
- AST externalization to XML
- Shared local variables
- Extern methods

Additionally, the following features described in the 1.7 language
manual do not currently work with the C++ backend and will be fixed in
the subsequent releases:

- Garbage collection on Cygwin and AIX
- Generic virtual methods
- Exception stack traces on Cygwin

Here's a list of known issues with the C++ backend:

- Default values are not assigned to some value types
- Static initialization is sometimes incorrectly ordered (at the moment
  it's very brittle, though somewhat controllable by the link order of
  files)
- Operator overloading does not work correctly sometimes
- Hash codes are not computed correctly for some classes

X10 1.7.7 uses polyglot version 3.1.1.

Below is a summary of JIRA issues addressed for the X10 1.7.7 release.
