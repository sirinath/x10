o openMP -- the original version in C + OpenMP

o smp -- Shared memory version of SSCA2 
   o kernel 4 not impelemented

o par-1d - 1d distributed version of SSCA2
  o (dist-1d) is it's older version

o par-1d-hybrid -- hybrid of SMP and par-1d (only KERNEL 3 is hybrid)

=====================


o Command Line Arguments for openmp with openmp disabled:

arg -1 : SCALE = Log of the size of the graph
     2 : set it to 1 always
     3 : set it to 1 always

o Command Line Arguments for openmp with openmp enabled:

arg -1: THREADS = # of THREADS
     2 : SCALE = Log of the size of the graph
     3 : set it to 1 always
     4 : set it to 1 always


o Command Line Arguments for par-1d and par-1d-hybrid:

arg -1 : SCALE = Log of the size of the graph

     2 : DUMP = true implies output is dumped (for checking correctness)
              = false implies no dump

     3 : SERIAL_GRAPH GEN = true if you want sequential graph 
                            false otherwise (RECOMMENDED for large graphs)

     4: FILTER = set it to TRUE always 

     5: CUT_SHORT = set it to TRUE always

     6: NO_SELF = true if you dont' want self loop
                  false otherwise

     7: ALLGATHER = set it to TRUE always 

     (4, 5, 6 and 7 are for debugging)

     8: USE_ASYNC = true implies async version of Betweness (It is very slow)
                  = false implies alltoall version (DEFAULT and RECOMMENDED)       

     9 : NTHREADS = # of threads per place (useful only for hybrid version) 

o Command Line Arguments for smp: (SMP version semantics is outdated and not in sync with the other versions)
arg -1: THREADS = # of THREADS
     2: SCALE = log of size of the graph
