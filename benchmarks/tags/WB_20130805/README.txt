This portion of the X10 svn repository contains
various benchmark programs written in X10. 

Our active benchmark development is currently mostly happening in the
PERCS subdirectory. This includes the codes used for the X10 2012 HPCC
submission. Please look in PERCS first for the latest versions of high
performance X10 code.

The OBSOLETE portion of the repository contains X10 benchmark programs
that are not being actively maintained.  Typically these programs are
written in X10 2.1 or X10 2.2.

The VERY_OLD portion of the repository contains benchmark programs
written in very old versions of X10 (eg pre X10 2.0) that would take
significant work to port forward to X10 2.3.

All of the other top level directories contain benchmarks that should work
with the current version of X10.  If you find some program that is not
under OBSOLETE or VERY_OLD doesn't work, then please let us know by
opening a JIRA: http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/XTENLANG.

We would be very happy to accept contributions of additional benchmark
programs (or ports of existing code in OBSOLETE or VERY_OLD to the
current version of X10).  If you want to undertake such an effort,
please let us know so we can coordinate community efforts.
