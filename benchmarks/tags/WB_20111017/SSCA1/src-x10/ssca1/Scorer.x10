   /**
    * Smith-Waterman algorithm in the simplest serial implementation: the outer loop reads left-to-right
    * over one of the sequences--by convention, we assume it is the shorter, although we do not make any
    * use of that in this particular method.  The inner loop is over the second, longer sequence.
    * 
    * The indexing in this function may be a little confusing on first reading.  In reading the inner
    * loop below to keep in mind that for a given i and j, we are looking at the effect of the i-1-st
    * element in the short sequence and the j-1-st element in the long.  The reason for this--what might
    * appear to be an "off by one" error--is that it makes tracing back from the ends much cleaner if the
    * traceback matrix has a "landing spot" at 0,j and i,0 where we can place a "STOP" sentinel.
    * 
    * As for the loop bounds: we go from 1 to length (inclusive) in each case.  Again, this might
    * seem wrong, but remember the indexing is shifted "up 1" from what one might expect, because
    * we have to refer to i-1 and j-1 at the (i,j)-th step.  
    *
    * The inner loop's indexing suffers from the same confusion.  At the very top of the INNER loop
    * (the loop on j) we know the best possible scores using subsequences that begin at i-2
    * or earlier in the shorter sequence and j-2 or less in the longer (the best scores 
    * being 0 if i-2<0 or j-2<0), so the best we can hope to do here is:
    *    1) add both the i-1-st from the short sequence to the short's match and the
    *           j-1-st entry from the long to the long's match
    *   2) add the j-1-st entry from the long sequence only, leaving a gap in the short's
    *           matching sequence, or  
    *   3) add the i-1-st entry from the short sequence only, leaving a gap in the long's
    *           matching sequence.
    * The scoring matrix tells us what we gain (or lose) by adding both.  The open and 
    * extend gap penalties tell us what we lose if we insert or enlarge gaps in the matches.
    * 
    * Try not to get too hung up figuring out how the indexing of the various arrays 
    * works: this is a tightly written loop that you may assume is correct and is designed
    * to avoid keep around a matrix containing all the previously computed best scores.
    * 
    * We COULD have written the critical part this loop this way:
    * 
    *    // Evaluate the current match
    *    scoreOfMatchAtLast = score(shortSequence[i - 1], longSequence[j - 1]);
    *    scoreUsingLastMatch = bestScore(i-1,j-1) + scoreOfMatchAtLast;  
    *    // Evaluate the score if we have to insert a(nother) gap in the I sequence
    *    bestIfGapInsertedInI = bestScore(i-1,j) - (getTracebackMove(i-1,j) == UP ? extendGapPenalty : openGapPenalty);               
    *    // Evaluate the score if we have to insert a(nother) gap in the J sequence
    *    bestIfGapInsertedInJ = bestScore(i,j-1) - (getTracebackMove(i,j-1) == LEFT ? extendGapPenalty : openGapPenalty);             
    *    // based on the best score of the three, choose the traceback direction
    *    winner = setBestScore(i, j, maxOrZero(scoreUsingLastMatch, bestIfGapInsertedInI, bestIfGapInsertedInJ));
    * 
    * The cost is maintaining the doubly-indexed array "bestScore".  In the case where the
    * short and long and long sequences are of comparable length, we actually found  a variation
    * on this form of the loop better in writing the MPI code, because it made the communication
    * among processors a lot easier to understand.
