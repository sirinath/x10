This portion of the X10 svn repository contains
various benchmark programs written in X10. 

The NOT_WORKING portion of the repository contains
benchmark programs written in previous versions of 
X10 that have not been fully updated to X10 2.0.

All of the other sub-directories contain benchmarks
that should work with the current version of X10.
If you find some program that is not under NOT_WORKING
doesn't work, then please let us know by opening a
JIRA: http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/XTENLANG.

We would be very happy to accept contributions of
additional benchmark programs (or ports of 
existing code in NOT_WORKING) to the current version
of X10.  If you want to undertake such an effort,
please let us know so we can coordinate community efforts.
