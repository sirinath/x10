/**
 * In order to compute the number of processors to use and the parameters for what part
 * of the longer string this process gets to analyze, the key number is the size of the
 * longest string, counting gaps, can come out of the algorithm.  The highest score we
 * can get is when the short sequence occurs as a subsequence of the long sequence, in
 * which case the score is maxScoreOnMatch, which we shall compute here.  If the penalty
 * for inserting a gap is openGapPenalty and that for extending one is extendGapPenalty,
 * then:
 *   if openGapPenalty is less than or equal to extendGapPenalty, the limit on gaps that
 *   one may introduce is 
 *                       maxScoreOnMatch/openGapPenalty
 *   otherwise that limit is 
 *           1 + (maxScoreOnMatch-openGapPenalty)/extendGapPenalty.
 * These bounds hold because, in either case, introducing another gap would drive the
 * score negative--and you can always get a score of 0 by having 0-length matches, so
 * the best match never has a negative score.
 * 
 * We will use maxAlignedLength to denote the implied bound on the length of longest
 * match: (the length of the shorter sequence + one less than the limit on how many
 * gaps can be inserted).
 * 
 * We assume that, when aligning two sequences, the highest score at any given entry
 * is achieved by matching the opposing entry exactly.  That is, we assume that ALL
 * mismatches must incur some penalty.  A more sophisticated version would loop over
 * all values in the scoring matrix that correspond to the entry as row index.
 *
 * One way we get parallelism by covering the long sequence with overlapping segments in
 * such a way that the winning segment must lie entirely in one of these larger segments.
 * Suppose, to begin with, that we cover with segments of length maxAlignedLength.
 * We would have to have one segment for each entry in the longer sequence up to and
 * including the entry at (longerLength - maxAlignedLength).  In general, though, this is
 * a horrifically redundant way to operate.  We can eliminate a lot of the redundancy and
 * still get most of the gain based on the observation that if A is one of the segments
 * and if B is the segment that immediately follows A, and if N is the index in A where
 * the overlap between A and B begins, then:
 *   If the overlap of B with A is at least maxAlignedLength-1, then a winner that
 *       starts in A BEFORE N must end in A.
 *   If B also extends at least maxAlignedLength-1 after N, or if the whole sequence ends in
 *       B, then a winner that starts in A BUT AFTER N, must end in B, .
 * Hence if we allow 2*maxAlignedLength-2 for the length of the segments and overlap
 * the right half of one with the left half of the next, we can ensure that each segment
 * can be processed independently and our best match will lie entirely in one of them.  
 * 
 * One reasonable heuristic, therefore, for the  number of processors one can profitably
 * use is to make the segment length 2*maxAlignedLength-2, and to make half of each segment
 * overlap with the next.  We can bound processes worth spawning by the number of segments
 * we need, or (if that number is too large) by the total number of places available.
 * As noted, there are other approaches: this is a significant tuning issue.
