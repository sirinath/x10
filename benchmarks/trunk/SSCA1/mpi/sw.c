 * 
 * The indexing in this function may be a little confusing on first reading.  In reading the inner

 * element in the short sequence and the j-1-st element in the long.  The reason for this--what might
 * appear to be an "off by one" error--is that it makes tracing back from the ends much cleaner if the
 * traceback matrix has a "landing spot" at 0,j and i,0 where we can place a "STOP" sentinel.
 * 
 * As for the loop bounds: we go from 1 to length-1 (inclusive) in each case.  Again, this might
 * seem wrong, but remember the lengths in question are the buffer sizes for the short and long
 * sequences, which are 1 longer than the actual sequence lengths, because of the C convention for
 * terminating strings with a 0 byte.  ALl the indexing is shifted "up 1" from what one might expect.
