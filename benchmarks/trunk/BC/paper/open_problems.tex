\section{Open Problems}

\begin{itemize}
\item Heirarchical approaches as all the existing approaches are for either 
distributed memory or are shared memory.
\item Out-of-core approaches as there is currently a notion that everything 
has to fit in memory; this is not necessarily going to be true. We need to 
be thinking out of core.
\item Graph partitioning is important as we cannot afford to replicate the 
graph at each node.
\item Approximate metrics are needed for computing betweeness centrality 
quickly.
\item Graph layout algorithms are needed to ensure that we do not incur too 
many cache misses.
\item If the graph is replicated, can we use any pure task parallelism 
techniques to solve the problem efficiently?
\end{itemize}
