Parallelizing BC became a key application for super computers to demonstrate
ever since the publication of the HPC Graph Analysis
Benchmarks~\cite{ssca_matlab}.
%
In this section, we will attempt to enumerate those efforts that are relevant
in that they deal with parallelism, scalability and betweenness centrality for
RMAT~\cite{Chakrabarti04:Recursive} graphs.
%
Bader et al.~\cite{Bader06:centrality} developed shared-memory parallel 
algorithms for various centrality metrics, including BC. 
%
In their work, they were able to compute BC metrics on graphs with $3$ million
nodes and $16$ million edges, and further claimed to be able to scale to
billions of nodes and edges.
%
In this work, they exploit fine-grained parallelism by involving multiple 
threads in finding shortest paths from a single source and coarse-grained
concurrency by starting shortest path searches from multiple sources 
simultaneously.
%
However, their approach does not exploit the vast amount of distributed-memory
parallelism that is on offer in most modern clusters and is not space
efficient.
%
Madduri et al.~\cite{Madduri:2009} presented a lock-free parallel algorithm for
computing BC, which significantly reduced synchronization overhead involved in
merging BC scores from various threads.
%
Their key idea was to replace predecessor set of a vertex $P_v(s)$ with a
successor set; this allows more parallelism as successor sets are private, as
opposed to predecessor sets, which have to be shared.
%
Using their approach, they were able to \textit{approximate} BC scores for a 
RMAT graph with billions of edges in a reasonable amount of time.
%
Like their previous efforts, they focussed exclusively on shared-memory
architectures.
%
Yang and Leonardi~\cite{Yang05} developed a distributed memory solution for 
BC, which achieves almost linear speedup (for at least 32 processors).
%
However, their approach relied on replicating the graph on all processors,
which is not space efficient and hence, not scalable.
%
Edmonds et al.~\cite{edmonds-hipc-2010} devised a space-efficient parallel 
BC computation targeted towards distributed-memory machines.
%
Their algorithm computes BC for both weighted and unweighted graphs, which are
partitioned \textit{a priori} with a space complexity of
$O(\lvert{}V\rvert{}+\lvert{}E\rvert{})$ building on the $\Delta{}$-stepping
single source shortest path solution by Meyer~\cite{Meyer03:DeltaStepping}.
