% Define BC
Betweenness Centrality (BC) is a graph theoretic metric of a node's importance
in a graph.~\footnote{In this paper, we focus exclusively on the unweighted,
directed graphs.}
%
Informally, a node's BC gives an indication of the ratio of the total number 
of shortest paths between all other nodes taken pair-wise.
%
That is, a node with a high centrality score can reach other nodes with 
relatively fewer hops than another node with a lower centrality score.
%
More formally, let $G(V,E)$ be a graph with the vertex set $V$ and edge set
$E$; let the number of vertices ($\lvert{}V\rvert{})$ be $n$ and the number of 
edges ($\lvert{}E\rvert{}$) be $m$.
%
The BC of a node (vertex) $v\in{V})$ is given by the equation:
%
\begin{equation}
BC_{v} = \sum_{s\ne{}v\ne{}t\in{}V}{\frac{\sigma{}_{st}(v)}{\sigma{}_{st}}}
\end{equation}
%
Where $\sigma{}_{st}$ is the number of shortest paths from node $s$ to node $t$ 
and $\sigma{}_{st}(v)$ is the number of those shortest paths that go through 
node $v$.
% Get into the simple means of computing BC
There are multiple ways of computing the BC scores of nodes in a graph; in the
following subsections, we highlight a few of these techniques.
%
Please note that regardless of the approach that is used in computing BC, the 
central kernel is enumerating all the shortest paths.

Every graph $G(V,E)$ can be represented as an adjacency matrix $A$, where an 
entry $a_{ij}$ is marked as $1$ \textit{iff} $(i,j)\in{}E$.
%
Figure~\ref{fig:sample} shows a sample four node graph and its related 
adjacency matrix; we will be using this graph as a running example throughout
this section.
%
By inspection, we can tell that the diameter of the graph is $3$; therefore, 
all the possible paths in the matrix (including the number of paths) can be 
enumerated by simply taking the powers of the adjacency matrix $A$; in other 
words, we find the transitive closure of the graph $G$.
