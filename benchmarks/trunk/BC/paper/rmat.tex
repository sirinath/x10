As important as it is to be able to compute social networking metrics such as
BC accurately and efficiently, it is also necessary to be able to generate
synthetic graphs that mimic real-world graphs for testing and comparative
purposes.
%
In recent years, RMAT graphs~\cite{Chakrabarti04:Recursive} have been widely
adopted for generating synthetic graphs that mimic the power-law
characteristics demonstrated by several real-world graphs.
%
The idea behind RMAT graphs is simple: a graph $G(V,E)$ is considered to be 
a boolean adjacency matrix $A$, where $A_{ij}=1$ implies the prescence to an 
edge between vertices $(i,j)$.
%
The edge connections are determined using an appropriate psuedo-random number 
generator (PRNG) with range $[0,1)$ and four carefully chosen weights $a,b,c,$
and $d$ ($a+b+c+d=1$).
%
These four weights reflect the probability that any given edge falls within one
of the four equal sized partitions that the adjacency matrix is recursively
divided into.
%
Typically, $a\ge{}b$, $a\ge{}c$, $a\ge{}d$; in many real-world scenarios,
$(a+b)/(c+d)=3$.
%
Recursion ends upon reaching a $1\times{}1$ cell (at some position $(i,j)$,
which cannot be sub-divided any further.
%
If, by chance, that cell is already occupied, the duplicate is either
discarded.~\footnote{Weighted RMAT graphs are generated by accumulating
duplicate edges that fall in the same cell. For example, if an $l$ edges happen
to fall within the same cell $(i,j)$, the edge weight of $(i,j)$ is set to be
$l$.}
%
Table~\ref{tbl:rmat} summarizes the various parameters involved in generating 
an RMAT graph.
