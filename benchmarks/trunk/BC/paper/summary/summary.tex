Betweenness centrality (BC) is an important metric that can be used to
determine the power of a vertex in a graph~\cite{Freeman77,Anthonisse71}.
%
Its uses range from analyzing social networks to power grids; in fact,
computing BC is one of the core kernels of DARPA's HPCS
SSCA\#2~\cite{ssca_matlab}, a benchmark designed to evaluate the capability of
emerging platforms to perform graph analytics.
%
Computing BC for a directed graph $G(V,E)$, with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges, is
both temporally and spatially demanding; the best known serial algorithm
requires $O(nm)$ time and $O(n+m)$ space if the edges are unweighted, and
$O(nm+n^2log(n))$ time and $O(n+m)$ space if the edges are
weighted~\cite{brandes01:_mathsoc}.
%
Given the burgeoning sizes of graphs that need to be analysed, many efforts
have attempted to parallelize BC computations with varying degrees of
success~\cite{Madduri:2009,Santos:2006,edmonds-hipc-2010,Yang05,buluc-2010};
the best known result~\cite{buluc-2010} has demonstrated scalability up to 
1225 cores on an unweighted graph with $32$ million modes and $\approx{}256$
million edges.
%
As such, an efficient and parallel algorithm for computing BC for massive-scale
weighted/unweighted graphs is a must on Hadoop~\cite{Hadoop}, which is IBM's
planned analytics platform.
%
To aid researchers in both developing and demonstrating scalability of such an
algorithm will require access to a large Hadoop cluster ($\ge{}2048{}$ cores,
$\ge{}4GB$ of memory/core) with either HDFS or GPFS support.
