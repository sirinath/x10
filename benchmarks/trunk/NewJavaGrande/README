Java Grande Forum benchmarks (with minor changes to the versions
presented in OOPLA 2005 paper).

The common source code in jgfutil has been moved to
examples/x10lib/jgfutil, so individual compilations must be done
with an appropriate -sourcepath parameter to x10c:

cd examples/Applications/NewJavaGrande/sor/distributed

x10c -sourcepath ../../../../x10lib JGFSORBenchSizeA.x10

x10 JGFSORBenchSizeA
