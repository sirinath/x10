============================================================
To install X10DT for the first time:
  (1) From Eclipse, invoke "Help" => "Software Updates" => "Find and Install"
  (2) In the dialog that shows up, select "Search for new features to install" and click "Next"
  (3) In the "Name" field type "SAFARI" (this can be anything you want, really).
      In the "URL" field type "http://orquesta.watson.ibm.com/eclipse/updates/SAFARI/"
      (note the trailing '/' character; it's significant)
  (4) Click "Ok"
  (5) Click "Finish"
  (6) On the "Search Results" page, check the "SAFARI" checkbox, and click "Next"
  (7) Click "I accept the terms..." and Click "Next"
  (8) Click "Finish"; the dialog will disappear, and the status bar will show progress as the
      Update Manager queries the update server for all available updates
  (9) Click "Install All"
  (10) Click "Yes" when asked whether to restart Eclipse.

To update (only if you've installed a previous version):

  (1) From Eclipse, invoke "Help" => "Software Updates" => "Find and Install"    http://orquesta.watson.ibm.com:1
  (2) Select "Search for updates of currently installed features"; click "Finish"
  (3) When prompted for update site mirrors, just click "Cancel" to accept the main site.
  (4) It often takes several minutes for Eclipse to contact the update sites and determine
      what updates are available.
  (5) If the SAFARI site shows updates, select the new version and click "Next".
      (5a) Accept the license agreement and click "Finish"/"Next"
      (5b) Click "Install All"
      (5c) Click "Yes" when asked whether to restart Eclipse

  If the SAFARI site doesn't show up in step 5 (not yet sure why it doesn't sometimes),
  cancel and try to install as though you hadn't previously installed (see above).
