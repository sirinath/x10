HOWTO: Install X10 project in Eclipse for CVS:
----------------------------------------------

What you need:

 - Eclipse 3.0 or later
 - an account in on quillback.cs.purdue.edu
 - your private ssh keys (windows users create 
   those under cygwin with the command ssh-keygen)

Procedure:

- Windows: copy keys generated by ssh-keygen to 
           c:\Documents and Setting\<your account>\ssh
- launch Eclipse
- select: File->New->Project
- CVS->Checkout Projects from CVS
- Create new Repository Location:
- Host: quillback.cs.purdue.edu
  Repository path: /home/ibmcvs
  User: <login on quillback>
  Password <leave empty!>
  Connection type: extssh
  use Default Port
  select Save Password
- Select Module: Check existing module: Eclipse 
  will establish a connection to the CVS host. If your 
  ssh settings / key is not correct, then you will fail here ... 
- If last step goes fine, your almost done: Select x10, then Next
- Choose "Check out As a Project in the workspace" 
  (you need not use Wizard!)
- All files will be copied out from the repository to 
  your 'local workspace' (CVS checkout).
- the x20 project will appear in the workspace.
