HOWTO: Translate and run X10 programs on the command line and with eclipse:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

What you need:

 - obtain the latest version of the code from CVS (update in Eclipse)
 - run the build.xml ant script in the root directory of the x10
  installation.  This should update the files bin/x10, bin/x10c and
  etc/standard.cfg
 - add the bin directory of the x10 installation to your system's
   search  path


Procedure:

 To translate and run the X10 examples from the command line:

 - cd x10/examples/testcases/working
 - x10c Future1Boxed.x10 (this will create .java files and translate
   them with javac to class files)
 - x10 Future1Boxed (will start the x10 runtime and run that program).


 To translate and run the X10 examples from eclipse:

 - right-click on the example to be translated:
 - choose "Run" from menu
   - main class: ployglot.main.Main
   - program arguments: -ext x10 ${resource_name}
   - vm args: -Dx10.configuration=${project_loc}/etc/standard.cfg
   - working directory: ${container_loc}

 - right-click on the example to be executed:
 - choose "Run" from menu
   - main class: x10.lang.Runtime
   - program arguments: Future1Boxed
   - classpath - User Entries - Advanced: add path 
     x10/examples/testcases/working
   - click OK
