LAPI is supported on AIX only, and so in essence should be ignored in Eclipse.  By default Eclipse
attempts to compile everything in it's directories unless you exclude that directory.  To do this,
select 'Project' from the menu, and Properites.  Note that you must be focused on the x10 project for this to
apply.

Select 'Java Build Path'.  There should be two choices on the right: "Included (All)" and "Excluded...".
Select "Excluded...".  Click Edit and add "lapi_support/**".  Click Ok and rebuild.
