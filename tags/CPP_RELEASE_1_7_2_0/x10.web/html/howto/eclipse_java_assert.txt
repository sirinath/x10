HOWTO: How do I get the Java assert statement to work in Eclipse?
------------------------------------------------------------------

How do I get the assert statement to work?

Go to Window -> Preferences -> Java -> Compiler -> Compliance and
Classfiles and set the Compiler Compliance Level to 1.4. This tells
the compiler to recognize and allow assert statements, but does not
enable them.

    In Eclipse 3, the settings are a little fussier. Go to Window ->
    Preferences -> Java -> Compiler -> Compliance and Classfiles and
    set:

        Compiler Compliance Level: to 1.4
        Use default compliance settings to unchecked
        Generated .class files compatibility: to 1.4
        Source compatibility: to 1.4
        Disallow identifiers called 'assert': to Error
        Compiler Compliance Level to 1.4

To enable (make active) assert statements, you must set a flag to the
compiler. Go to Run -> Run... -> Arguments, and in the box labeled VM
arguments:, enter either -enableassertions or just -ea. Accept the
changes and close the dialog.

To get Javadoc to recognize the assert statement:

1. In the Package Explorer window, choose the package or file for
   which you want to generate documentation.

2. Choose File -> Export... -> Javadoc -> Next>

3. Select the project, and the destination for the javadoc
   files. Normally, you should only generate documentation for public
   fields and methods.

4. If you have no assert statements, you can click Finish at this
   point.

5. Click Next > Click Next >

6. Check JRE 1.4 source compatibility (otherwise your assert
   statements will be treated as errors). [See also How do I get the
   assert statement to work?]  Click Finish.
