\section{Introduction}
\section{List of output files}
The \XCPP{} compiler generates three files per public \Xten{} class, which
combined together reflect the behavior of the original \Xten{} class. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item A header file (.h) that contains the skeleton for the translated class, and the
forward declarations required for the skeleton class.

\item A .cc file that contains the definitions of all the members of the
class.

\item A .inc file that contains the bodies of the different closures that
are built for invoking \async{} statements, and a dispatcher that invokes \async{}s.
\end{enumerate}
