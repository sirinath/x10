This is the Developer's Note for X10 Runtime System.  Please follow the guidelines
specified while adding/modifying the code.


* All the messaging layer functionality should be under src subdir.

* Scheduler and Activities related code should go into src/sched subdir.

* Arrays and GAS related code should go into src/array subdir.

* All documentation files (design/api/style guide) including man pages should
  go into doc subdir.  If required, create appropriate subdirs under doc subdir.

* Examples subdir should contain programs that are relevant for C/C++ programmers
  who are linking directly against the library.  If possible, an example should
  be specified in both C and C++ language versions for the benefit of respective
  community.

* Regression testing code should go directly into test subdir.

* Every benchmark will go into a separate directory under "benchmarks" subdir.
  If possible, the benchmark code should be realized both in C and C++ languages.

* Use either "r36n11.pbm.ihost.com" or "rlsecomp1.watson.ibm.com" for development.
  Both are POWER5 SMP systems running AIX 5.3 OS.

* All source files should include X10 header files with "x10/" prefix i.e.,
  for including "x10lib.h", use <x10/x10lib.h>.

* Expose newly created types through <x10/types.h> header file for name resolution.

* Library wide error codes should be part of <x10/err.h> header file.

* Make a reference to your newly created header files in "x10lib.h" as this is
  the only public interface available for the programmer to use.

* Sample source files are available under "src" subdirs for guiding the programmer
  to extend the respective functionality.

* Suffix your template files with ".tcc".  For example, array template file
  should be named "array.tcc".

* Template files should not be exposed.  Include them in header files i.e.,
  "array.tcc" should be part of "array.h".

* Makefiles recognize the following C++ suffixes: .cc .cxx .cpp .C
