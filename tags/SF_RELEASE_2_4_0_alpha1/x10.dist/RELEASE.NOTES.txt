MAJOR CHANGES

Summary
  (1) Shift to 64 bit Rail/Array/etc.

  (3) Numerous class library API changes in support of
      emphasis of 64bit integers/addresses

LIMITATIONS OF THIS RELEASE

The following features described in the 2.4 language manual do not
currently work and may be fixed in the subsequent releases:
  - Non-static type definitions as class or interface members
    (static type defs do work)

The constraint solver used by X10 typechecker is known to be incomplete 
for situations in which a constraint implies an infinite number of 
distinct constraints.

Additionally, the following features described in the language
manual do not currently work with Native X10.
  - Garbage collection on AIX
  - Non-final generic instance methods
  - Exception stack traces on Cygwin

Although greatly improved from previous releases, the X10 runtime 
still uses a modified "busy wait" loop in the worker threads that 
execute asyncs. A consequence of this is that even if a Place has 
no asyncs to execute, one worker thread in the Place will still consume
CPU cycles busy waiting for messages to arrive from the network.  

The generated C++ code requires g++ 4.2 or better to be compiled; 
we do almost all of our testing against g++ 4.4.
  + On AIX and Power/Linux, you may either use g++ 4.2 or better or 
    xlC 10.1.0.4 or better. 
  + Some versions of Xcode on MacOS default to using the Clang C++
    front-end; Clang cannot compile the generated C++ code; you need to
    use the g++ front-end.  To do this export CC=gcc; CXX=g++.
