BadPlaceException checks

The compiler will perform the following translation in this phase.

Unless the compiler can establish that the place type of o is here, or
is definitely not here (in which case it emits a static error) the
compiler will

o Translate each field access o.f to ((@here) o).f. 
o Each field write o.f = e to 

  F olocal = (@here) o;
  olocal.f = e;


The compiler uses the following rules in order to determine the static
place type of an object o.

o The static place type of this is
