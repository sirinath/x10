                               LU Factorization with partial pivoting. 

The three steps (pivot, exchange, update) are sequential in LU, although 
there is parallelism in each of them. This implementation overlaps these 
three steps using X10's conditional blocks. The operation of previous update is 
overlapped with the current ones of pivot and exchange. We use flags to 
coordinate the three operations.

The computation is in place, L is represented by the elements of A below the diagonal,
(the diagonal is all-1) and U is represnted by the elements of A above the diagonal.
The permutation information is stored in p so that L*U=A(p,:) in Matlab notation. 
The matrix A can have any distribution. 

The code uses implicit syntax.
