We are actively writing programs with constrained types in
\Xten{} and 
working to extend the expressive power of the type system.
In particular, we are focusing on the following extensions:

\paragraph{Driving optimization.}
\paragraph{Clocks.}
\paragraph{Type constraints.}
By allowing classes to have type properties as well as value properties,
and by incorporating subtyping constraints into the language, we believe we can achieve the expressive power of generics.

\paragraph{Type inference.}  Constrainted types can be burdensome for
programmer to write down.  A type inference algorithm for constrained types.

\paragraph{Flow sensitivity.}  The following code should type-check:
\begin{xten}
int x = ...;
int(:self >= 0) y;
if (x >= 0) {
    y = x;
}
\end{xten}

\paragraph{State-dependent constrained types.}
