HOWTO: Run the x10 parser on an X10 program inside Eclipse
----------------------------------------------------------

- Right click on the X10 project; select run; select run (in submenu)
   (a  "Run" window will pop up.)

- Click on new (at the bottom left-hand side)
     - Chose a name (For example, "X10 Parse") and type it in the 
       name window
     - The main class is "x10.parser.Main". Type it in the "Main 
       class" window.

- Click on the Arguments tab
    - click on variables; chose "resource_loc"; click on OK

- Click on Classpath tab
    - click on Advanced on the right-hand panel; chose "add folders" 
      and click ok
    - click on the (+) x10 folder to expand it; under x10, click on 
      (+) src to expand it; under src, click on (+)x10; chose "parser" 
      and click on OK

- Click on APPLY in the Run window

- Click on CLOSE in the Run window.

To run an example: select the example (left-click on the file); using
the right-mouse button, select run and chose "X10 Parse".

If the word "Success" is printed at the console then the parse was
succesful. Otherwise, syntax error messages will be printed. Note that
the parser does not yet process tab characters. Thus, if an input line
with embedded tabs contains an error, the column number identified as
the location of the error may be wrong. Simply remove the tabs and the
location will be properly identified.
