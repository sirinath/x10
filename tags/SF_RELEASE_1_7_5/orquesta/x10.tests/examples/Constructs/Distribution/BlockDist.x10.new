 * Testing block dist.

 * Randomly generate block dists and check
 * index-to-place mapping for conformance with x10 0.41 spec
 *
 * The dist block(R, Q) distributes the elements of R (in
 * order) over the set of places Q in blocks as follows. Let p equal
 * |R| div N and q equal |R| mod N, where N is the size of Q. The first
 * q places get successive blocks of size (p + 1) and the remaining
 * places get blocks of size p.
