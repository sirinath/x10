Challenges in AMR

-- Irregular data access and computation. Arises from handling the
   boundary conditions at the boundaries between adjacent levels of
   the nested hierarchy of grids.

   For the computation at a grid at level l, values are needed through
   interpolation from the grid at level l-1 (coarser), and through
   averaging at grid level l+1.
