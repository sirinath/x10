\subsection{LAPI}

LAPI (Low-level API)~\cite{lapi} provides efficient remote memory access
mechanisms (one-sided communication).  The LAPI library provides basic
operations to ``put'' data to and ``get'' data from one or more
virtual addresses of a remote task.  LAPI also provides an active
message infrastructure. With active messaging, programmers can install
a set of handlers that are called and run in the address space of a
target task on behalf of the task originating the active message.
These handlers can be used to dynamically determine the target address
(or addresses) where data from the originating task must be stored.

LAPI may operate either in {\em polling} or {\em interrupt} mode. In the former, a
user pthread invoking a LAPI function may be temporarily borrowed to
send or receive messages. In the latter a dedicated single pthread
(created at initialization time) is responsible for handling message
send/receive traffic.
