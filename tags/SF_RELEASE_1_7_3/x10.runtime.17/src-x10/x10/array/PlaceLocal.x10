/**
 * A simple implementation of place-local storage. This implementation
 * uses a sparsely populated ValRail (one entry per Place.MAX_PLACES)
 * to store the local data, and therefore it does not scale.
 *
 * A better implementation would use a HashMap keyed on the place
 * instead of a rail to store the local data, but this must be a value
 * (since it would store data for every place), so that would require
 * a ValHashMap. This would still have the problem of storing local
 * values everywhere, which is unlikely to be helpful.
 * 
 * An even better implementation would use a per-place static HashMap
 * keyed on a unique id for this PlaceLocal object to store only
 * place-local data for that place (on the assumption that it is
 * usually needed only in that place), but the language currently does
 * not support static place-local.
 *
 * Ultimately in any case this will have a native implementation that
 * supports very large numbers of places efficiently. Such an
 * implementation may also provide, and use here, a special-case
 * representation for Iterable[Place] to efficiently support very
 * large numbers of places.
