There are two modes for the X10 reference compiler: single-VM and multi-VM.  There is additional and
overhead associated with the multi-VM version that is unneccessary in the single node version, hence the
two modes.

Single node is the default.  To enable the multiVM version, an additional clause must be specified in
the configuration file: "COMPILER_FRAGMENT_DATA_EXT_DIRECTORY".
This must point to a directory which may contain xcd template files.  Any xcd files found in this directory
will be used instead of their singleVM equivalent.  For instance, the statement

final [.] X = new int[0:1];

will generate code for a sharedmemory integer array.  However, is the following stanza is added to your config
file (e.g. standard.cfg), assuming x10 is installed in 'd:/x10/eclipse/workspace/x10',

COMPILER_FRAGMENT_DATA_EXT_DIRECTORY=D:/x10/eclipse/workspace/x10/dataext/

then generated code will be for a distributed integer array ie the template int_array_dist_op.xcd is selected from
the dataext directory instead of from the data directory.
