1. CNS was originally developed by ExaCT Co-Design Center  as a proxy App. Reference at:
   http://exactcodesign.org/proxy-app-software/
2. This package is prepared for D-TEC as a miniApp example for DSL research.
3. This version is extracted from BoxLib git repository.  Original package is available at 
   https://ccse.lbl.gov/BoxLib/index.html.
4. Information about mathematical equation can be found in CNSEquations.pdf
5. To run C version, please add thie following line in GNUmakefile: USE_C_FUNC := t
6. Three difference C versions are provided.  Rename or copy the C code to advance_C.c.  
   The GNUMakefile will do the rest for compilation.
   a. advance_C_translated_by_ROSE.c. Original translated version with complex subscript.
      Arrays are linearized single-dimensional arrays.
   b. advance_C_opt.c. Optimized version with simplified array subscript.
      Arrays are linearized single-dimensional arrays.
   c. advance_C_multiDimArray.c. Optimized version with simplified array subscript.
      Arrays are multi-dimensional C arrays.
7. Unset NDEBUG in GNUMakefile to turn on debugging mode.
8. Set MPI, and OMP in GNUMakefile to support MPI and OpenMP.  However, these are not fully tested.
9. The default compileris are gfortran and gcc.  Modify F_mk/comps/gfortran.mak for different compilers.

This compact app integrates the compressible Navier Stokes equations
with constant viscosity and thermal conductivity.  

It is a BoxLib based code designed to run in parallel using a hybrid
model with MPI to distribute grid patches and OpenMP directives to thread
the loops over data in the grid patches.

The integration algorithm uses 8th order finite differences in space with
a 3rd order, low-storage TVD RK algorithm in time.

This represents the beginning of a line of development that explores
an S3D like method with both a different discretization and implementation approach 

The spatial discretization uses a more compact differencing scheme that requires
less communication but more floating point work.  The implementation is based
on a single-communication step per RK-stage.  

The directory includes a makefile and a sample inputs file.  Plotfiles are generated
that can be viewed with amrvis3d (CCSE's native vis / spreadsheet tool) or with visit.

To build the code you need to specify the location where you have placed BoxLib
