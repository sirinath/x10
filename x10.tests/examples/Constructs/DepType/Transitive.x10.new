 * The test checks that information in the types of variables occuring in depclauses is used
 * during entailment. Here b is of type region(:rank==a.rank), so it would seem that it does
 * not entail self.rank==2. However, a is of type region(:rank==2), and so it is definitely the case
 * that a.rank==2. Hence self.rank==2, and the assignment should succeed.
