/**
 * Represents a closure.<br>
 * You'd think it wouldn't be necessary to have a representation of (nameless) closures in the
 * type system outside of <code>ClosureTypes</code>, but the control-/data-flow framework requires
 * that all code bodies have an associated instance. See <code>CodeNode.codeInstance()</code>, and
 * <code>Closure.enterScope()</code>, which needs to push something on the Context stack, but the
 * only reasonable thing to push is some form of <code>CodeInstance</code>. Perhaps there should be
 * a more general kind of "code context" class, with a corresponding push method on
 * <code>Context</code>.
