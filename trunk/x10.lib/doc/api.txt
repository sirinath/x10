01) Initialization & Termination
--------------------------------


Init
----

Purpose: Initializes the X10 Runtime System.

Library: libx10.a

C++ syntax:

#include <x10/x10lib.h>
int x10lib::Init(handlers, n)
	x10_async_handler_t *handlers;
	int n;

C syntax:

#include <x10/x10lib.h>
int x10_init(handlers, n)

Parameters:

	INPUT
	handlers	Specifies a set of handlers that needs to be registered for
				remote async execution.
	n			The number of handlers that need to be registered.

Description:

	Initializes data structures needed for communication as well as registers
	handler addresses into an internal handler table, if handlers argument is
	not NULL and n is > 0.
	This method/function must be called before placing any other X10Lib calls.

Return values:

	X10_ERR_LAPI	Unable to create the LAPI context for communication.


Finalize
--------

C++ syntax:

#include <x10/x10lib.h>
int x10lib::Finalize()

C syntax:

#include <x10/x10lib.h>
int x10_finalize()

Description:

	This method/function must be called after using X10Lib calls.
	It is an error when any X10Lib calls are made after this routine is called.
	Internally, it terminates and cleans up the LAPI context used for communication.

Return values:
	X10_OK		Indicates the method/function call completed successfully.
	X10_ERR_LAPI	Unable to destroy the underlying LAPI context.


02) Remote Copy Interface for Contiguous Data

int x10lib::Get(src, dest, n)
	x10_gas_ref_t src;
	void *dest;
	int n;

C syntax:

#include <x10/x10lib.h>

Description:

	Fetches n contiguous bytes from src address on a remote node
	to the dest address on the local node.
	This method is internally implemented by an RDMA if possible.

08) Address Related
-------------------


Register
--------

Purpose: Registers the address of a function.

Library: libx10.a

C++ syntax:

#include <x10/x10lib.h>
int x10lib::Register(addr, addr_hndl)
	void *addr;
	int addr_hndl;

C syntax:

#include <x10/x10lib.h>
int x10_register(addr, addr_hndl)
	void *addr;
	int addr_hndl;

Parameters:

	INPUT
	addr	Specifies the address of the function handler to register.
	addr_hndl	Specifies the table index at which the above address is indexed.

Description:

	Use this method/function to register the address of a handler.
	The function address is maintained in an internal table.

Return values:

	X10_OK		Indicates the method/function call completed successfully.
	X10_ERR_LAPI	Error from the underlying communication system.


AddrInit
--------

Purpose: Create a remote address table.

Library: libx10.a

C++ syntax:

#include <x10/x10lib.h>
int x10lib::AddrInit(my_addr, addr_tab)
	void *my_addr;
	void *addr_tab[];

C syntax:

#include <x10/x10lib.h>
int x10_addr_init(my_addr, addr_tab)
	void *my_addr;
	void *addr_tab[];

Parameters:

	INPUT
	my_addr	Specifies the address supplied by each task.

	OUTPUT
	addr_tab	Specifies the address table, the size of which is greater
				than or equal to number of tasks.
Description:

	This is a collective call which is used to exchange virtual addresses
	among all tasks.
	Upon completion of this call, add_tab[j] contains the virtual address
	entry that was provided by task j.

Return values:

	X10_OK		Indicates the method/function call completed successfully.
	X10_ERR_LAPI	Error from the underlying communication system.


09) Active messages
-------------------

Purpose: Execute an user specified method on the remote task.

Library: libx10.a

C++ syntax:

error_t 
x10lib::asyncSpawnInline (dest, handler, n, args);
error_t
x10lib::asyncSpawnInline (dest, handler, arg0);
error_t
x10lib::asyncSpawnInline (dest, handler, arg0, arg1);
	place_t dest;
        async_handler_t handler;
        int n;
        async_arg_t* args;
        async_arg_t arg0;
        async_arg_t arg1;

Parameters:

	INPUT
	dest	Specifies the remote node id.
	n	Specifies the number of arguments to the remote method routine.
        handler Specifies the remote method by a unique constant number. It is
                the users responsibility to create this unique number for every
                remote method.
        args    Specifies an array of arguments. For simplicity, different version
                of asyncSpawnInline that take different number of remote method
                arguments are defined.

Description:

	Use this method/function to execute another method in remote node. The 
        function just passes the handler to the remote node and invokes
        the user defined function asyncSwitch, which has the following
        prototype.
     
        error_t asyncSwitch (async_handler_t handler, async_arg_t* args, int niter);

        The body of the asyncSwitch should invoke the remote method corresponding to
        the handler and repeat it niter times. For non-aggregate asyncs, niter is 1.
        asyncSwitch should be declared in the user program. Typically, the body of
        asyncSwitch is of the following from:

        error_t 
        asyncSwitch (async_handler_t handler, async_arg_t* args, int niter) 
        {
          for (int i = 0; i < niter; i ++)
            switch (handler) {
              case 0 : 
                async0 (*args++);
                break;
              case 1 :
                async1 (*args++, *args++)
                break;
              ....
            }
        }

Return values:

	X10_OK		Indicates the method/function call completed successfully.
	X10_ERR_LAPI	Error from the underlying communication system.

Note:
    
Aggregation:
-----------

Purpose:  Enqueue the active messages and execute them as an aggregate
	  on the remote task. The size of the aggregate is fixed by the library.  
          Once the aggregation limit is reached, the active messages are sent
          to the destination and executed there.

Library: libx10.a

C++ Syntax:

error_t 
x10lib::asyncSpawnInlineAgg (dest, handler, n, args);
error_t
x10lib::asyncSpawnInlineAgg (dest, handler, arg0);
error_t
x10lib::asyncSpawnInlineAgg (dest, handler, arg0, arg1);
	place_t dest;
        async_handler_t handler;
        int n;
        async_arg_t* args;
        async_arg_t arg0;
        async_arg_t arg1;

Parameters:

	INPUT
	dest	Specifies the remote node id.
	n	Specifies the number of arguments to the remote method routine.
        handler Specifies the remote method by a unique constant number. It is
                the users responsibility to create this unique number for every
                remote method.
        args    Specifies an array of arguments. For simplicity, different version
                of asyncSpawnInlineAgg that take different number of remote method
                arguments are defined.

Description:

          The requirements are the same as asyncSpawnInline. Users should define asyncSwitch in his program.

Return values:

	X10_OK		Indicates the method/function call completed successfully.
	X10_ERR_LAPI	Error from the underlying communication system.

Flush
-----
Purpose : Flush all the outstanding aggregated active messages. 

C++ Syntax:

error_t 
x10lib::asyncflush (handle, n)
        async_handler_t handle;
        int n;

Parameters:
  
        INPUT

        handle  Specifies the handle of the active message to be flushed.
                It is solely the user's responsibility to provide the same
                handle as that used by asyncSpawnInlineAgg. Failure to do so
                will lead to un-predictable results.
	n	Specifies the number of arguments to the  remote method.

Description:

	Use this method/function to flush all the outstanding aggregated active messages.
        Typically, a call to a flush is performed before Gfence(). 

Return values:

	X10_OK		Indicates the method/function call completed successfully.
	X10_ERR_LAPI	Error from the underlying communication system.

Note:
