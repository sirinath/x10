\subsection{Messaging Passing Interface (MPI)}
MPI is a popular two-sided messaging passing communication
support. MPI-2 adds one-sided extensions, albeit with complex semantics. 
MPI is still primarily used as a two-sided library.
It is available on almost all high performance
computing platforms. Inter-operability with MPI can ease user
acceptance of \Xtenlib. In addition, \Xtenlib{} uses the process management
framework from MPI, i.e., an \Xtenlib{} program is started as an MPI
program.
