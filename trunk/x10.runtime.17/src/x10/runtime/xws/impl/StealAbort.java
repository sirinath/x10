/**
 * An instance of StealAbort is thrown by the victim when it discovers that the current
 * frame has been stolen. This causes the Java call stack to be unwound. The exception is
 * caught in the scheduler. Since the exception is not meant to carry any meaningful information,
 * a single exception is precreated and used to respond to all steals.
 * 
 * The design of this library is based on the Cilk runtime, developed by the Cilk
 * group at MIT.
