Running x10/bin/testScript in command line mode, without Eclipse,
on  cygwin/Windows, AIX, or Linux:
=================================================================

x10.common/bin/testScript is the shell script that is used by the nightly
regression tests for x10. It may be useful for x10 developers
to ensure that any new code that is checked in will not cause
additional test cases to fail. It produces a file x10.common/examples/log
that contains the test results.

Directions for cygwin/windows only (tested on a Windows XP laptop):

(1) Refresh your cygwin installation from www.cygwin.com. In
particular: /bin/bash, /usr/bin/kill,  /usr/bin/perl are needed
by the scripts.  You can use the mirror mirror.mcs.anl.gov since
it is fast.

(2) Download and install java 1.4.2 (IBM'ers should use
http://w3.hursley.ibm.com/java/jim/).  Ensure that JAVA_HOME is
set correctly and that javac and java already work on cygwin.
 

Directions for Linux only (tested on samwise.watson.ibm.com):

(1) To log in to samwise.watson.ibm.com, you must have a gsa id.

(2) Ensure that JAVA_HOME is set correctly to point to a 1.4.x
installation and that javac and java already work.

Directions for AIX only (tested on rios2.watson.ibm.com):

(1) Ensure you have a gsa id, and an agora id, and be sure you
are logged into gsa if the agora and gsa passwords are not already
synchronized and your home directory is on gsa.

(2) Ensure that JAVA_HOME is set correctly to a 1.4.x
installation and that javac and java already work.


The following apply to all platforms, unless indicated otherwise:

Download the latest ant binary distribution from www.apache.org
and install in ~/apache-ant-1.6.5  (whichever is the
latest version number for ant).

Place your private key and public key for  ssh (id_dsa* files)
under ~/.ssh/

Use bash as your shell, and add the following to the end of your
~/.bashrc file:


QUILLBACK_USER=yourPurdueUserid 
export ANT_HOME=~/apache-ant-1.6.5
export X10=~/x10.common
export X10_PLATFORM=win32_x86 #for cygwin/windows only
#export X10_PLATFORM=linux_x86 #for Linux only
#export X10_PLATFORM=aix_ppc #for AIX only
export PATH=.:$JAVA_HOME/bin:$ANT_HOME/bin:$X10/bin:$PATH
export CVSROOT=:ext:$QUILLBACK_USER@quillback.cs.purdue.edu:/home/ibmcvs
export CVS_RSH=ssh
export CVSUMASK=770
 
Enter the commands (in your home directory):

cvs checkout -PA x10.common #do this one time only

buildAll #this will checkout/update and ant-build all required projects

cd x10.common/examples

testScript

Note: testScript will look for past nightly test logs in directory
~/x10web/html/testLogs (../../x10web/html/testLogs relative to the
~/x10.common/examples directory), to report on when each bug first
appeared.  You can create this directory by doing: "cvs checkoout
x10web" in your home directory. This is not necessary; testScript
will still work if it cannot find the old test logs and report
today's date as the first date a bug appeared.

You can enter: 

testScript -h | less

for more information about testScript options, and the format
requirements for the x10 test cases.

To execute a quick version of the test script that runs only a
subset of the regression tests, use (in the examples/ directory):

testScript -testList sanity.lst
