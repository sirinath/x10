Running x10/bin/testScript in command line mode, without
Eclipse, on  cygwin/Windows, AIX, or Linux:
=========================

For cygwin/windows only (tested on a Windows XP laptop):

(1) Refresh your cygwin installation from www.cygwin.com. In
particular: bash, /usr/bin/kill,  perl are needed by the scripts.
You can use the mirror mirror.mcs.anl.gov since it is
fast.
(2) download and install java 1,4.2 (IBM'ers should use
http://w3.hursley.ibm.com/java/jim/).  Ensure that JAVA_HOME is
set correctly and that javac and java already work on cygwin.
 

For linux only (tested on samwise.watson.ibm.com):

(1) To log in to samwise.watson.ibm.com, you must have a gsa id.
(2) Ensure that JAVA_HOME is set correctly and javac and java
already work.

For AIX only (tested on rios2.watson.ibm.com)

(1) Ensure you have a gsa id, and an agora id, be sure you are
logged into gsa if the passwords are not already synchronized
and your home directory is on gsa.

(2) Ensure that JAVA_HOME is already set correctly and javac and
java already work.


The following apply to all platforms, unless indicated
otherwise: 

Download the latest ant binary distribution from www.apache.org and install
in ~/apache-ant-1.6.4 

Place your private key and public key for  ssh (*id* files) under ~/.ssh

Use bash as your shell, and add these to the end of your ~/.bashrc file:


#QUILLBACK_USER=yourUserid 
export ANT_HOME=~/apache-ant-1.6.4
export X10=~/x10
export X10_PLATFORM=win32_x86 #for cygwin/windows only
#export X10_PLATFORM=linux_x86 #for Linux only
#export X10_PLATFORM=aix_ppc #for AIX only
export PATH=.:$JAVA_HOME/bin:$ANT_HOME/bin:$X10/bin:$PATH
export CVSROOT=:ext:$QUILLBACK_USER@quillback.cs.purdue.edu:/home/ibmcvs
export CVS_RSH=ssh
export CVSUMASK=770
 
Enter the commands (in your home directory):

cvs checkout x10 #one time only, initially

cd $X10
cvs -q update -dPA
ant --noconfig clobber all
cd examples
testScript

(the --noconfig option is needed only on Linux, 
in order not to conflict with old ant that may be
installed)


To execute a quick version of the test script that runs only a
subset of the tests, use (in the examples/ directory):

testScript -testList sanity.lst
