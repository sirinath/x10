HOWTO: Install X10 project in Eclipse for CVS:
----------------------------------------------

What you need:

 - Eclipse 3.0 or later
 - an account in on quillback.cs.purdue.edu
 - your private ssh keys (windows users create 
   those under cygwin with the command ssh-keygen)

1) Procedure:

- Before you access CVS through ssh on quillback.cs.purdue.edu,
  try "ssh -l<user> quillback.cs.purdue.edu". You should obtain a 
  prompt on quillback without entering the passphrase. When you 
  do this for the first time, you will be asked if quillback's 
  key shall be added to your 'known-hosts' file - just confirm 
  'yes'.
  If this step does not work for you, the the following will 
  not work either. In this case, get in contact with me, 
  <praun@us.ibm.com>.

- Windows: copy keys generated by ssh-keygen to 
           c:\Documents and Setting\<your account>\ssh
- launch Eclipse
- select: File->New->Project
- CVS->Checkout Projects from CVS
- Create new Repository Location:
- Host: quillback.cs.purdue.edu
  Repository path: /home/ibmcvs
  User: <login on quillback>
  Password <leave empty!>
  Connection type: extssh
  use Default Port
  select Save Password
- Select Module: Check existing module: Eclipse 
  will establish a connection to the CVS host. If your 
  ssh settings / key is not correct, then you will fail here ... 
- If last step goes fine, your almost done: Select x10, then Next
- Choose "Check out As a Project in the workspace" 
  (you need not use Wizard!)
- All files will be copied out from the repository to 
  your 'local workspace' (CVS checkout).

  Required projects:

    polyglot     // polyglot 1.3
    lpg          // parser generator
    pe           // performance explorer
    junit        // junit testing 
    x10.compiler // x10 translator
    x10.runtime  // x10 runtime
    x10.common   // scripts and config files common to runtime and compiler
  
  Optional projects:
 
    x10.lib        // x10 std library
    x10.test       // unit tests for compiler and runtime
    x10.vm         // vm interface
    x10.man        // x10 related documentations 
    x10.installer  // x10 installer package
    x10.design     // paper that influenced the x10 design
    x10web         // x10 web pages
    x10apps        // x10 JGF application in several variants

  All projects build automatically in the workspace.
  

3) ALTERNATIVELY: Checkout required projects as a project set as f
   follows:

 - Download http://delhi.watson.ibm.com/x10-project-set.psf
 - Open new workspace
 - File --> Import --> Team Project Set: choose file x10-project-set.psf
 - Eclipse might ask to configure CVS access as above.
