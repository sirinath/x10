\section{Graph algorithms in \XWS}\label{sec:Graph}

We consider implementations of breadth-first and depth-first search.

\subsection{\XWS implementation}

The code for psuedo-DFS is straightforward. A job created from the root
is submitted to the pool. This call returns only when all the 
(concurrent) work associated with this job has terminated. 
{\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
  pool.invoke(root.makeJob());
\end{verbatim}
}
