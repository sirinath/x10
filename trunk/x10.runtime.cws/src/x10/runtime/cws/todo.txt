Replaced calls in AdaptiveDFS to w.popFrameAndReset() with calls to w.popFrame. 
Added a call to cache.reset() in the loop in the scheduler which pops tasks and executes them.

I believe these are correct changes. There should be no need for the victim to reset
exception if all it is doing is pushing tasks onto the queue. A reset in the loop (as above)
should do the job. 

-- Get rid of closures if the job is globally quiescent. (done)
-- SpanF is leaving garbage behind. Prolly closure needs to be cleaned out?

-- Removed references to lock.unlock() from Worker. Should only call this.unlock().
