------- KEY ISSUES:

Parallel UTS is 35x slower than sequential UTS with Java back
end. (Parallel version does not yet work with C++ back end). Probably
due to excessive memory allocation.

Using generic classes vs non-generic costs 30x in peformance with C++
back end. Profiling shows probably due to 16 extra method calls per
update (=apply/set pair) in generic vs non-generic.

Rail access is 6x slower than hand-coded with Java back end. Profiling
shows likely due to boxing.

Sequential UTS is 4.5x slower than hand-coded with C++ back end.

Rail access is 2x slower than hand-coded with C++ back-end. 

Wrapping rail access in a minimal array-like class (with apply and
set) costs 2x in peformance with both Java and C++ back end.

C++ back-end is faster than Java back-end for the simple tests (rail,
non-generic pseudo-array), slower for the more complex tests (generic
array, sequential UTS).

------- COLUMNS:

------- ROWS (TESTS):

The first four tests are grouped together because they do essentially
the same work (from the application perspective) and so should ideally
perform the same.

SeqRail2

    Basic rail performance test. Allocate a rail, assign values to
    each element, read it back. Test is written to simulate treating
    the rail as a 2-d array in order (nested loop with index
    calculation) to facilitate comparisons with array performance
    tests SeqPseudoArray2{a,b} and SeqArray2

SeqPseudoArray2a

    Does the same work as SeqRail2, but wrapped in a class with an
    apply and set method to simulate the "best possible" X10 code for
    a 2-d double (non-generic) array class.

SeqPseudoArray2b

    Like SeqPseudoArray2a, but generic instead of double.

SeqArray2

    The actual x10.lang.Array code.

SeqUTSBin1

    Sequential version of an the Unbalanced Tree Search
    benchmark. Recursively visits nodes of a randomly generated tree.

ParUTSBin1

    Parallel version of an the Unbalanced Tree Search
    benchmark. Recursively visits nodes of a randomly generated tree.
