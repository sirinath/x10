This program is controlled by the Eclipse Public Licence v1.0.

This is a distribution of the 1.7.5 release of the X10 Programming Language.
http://x10-lang.org/
http://x10.sf.net/

To complete the installation, the scripts in bin/ may need to be made
executable.

Set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to point to the
directory where you find bin/java.

Java backend instructions
-------------------------
To compile an X10 source program using the Java backend, invoke
"bin/x10c <class_name>.x10".
See "bin/x10c --help" for command-line help.

To run the compiled X10 class, invoke "bin/x10 <class_name>".
See "bin/x10 --help" for command-line help.

C++ backend instructions
------------------------
Make sure the X10LIB environment variable points to an installation
of the PGAS common runtime.  If the PGAS common runtime is
installed into the same directory as the X10 distribution, the
X10LIB variable does not need to be set.

To compile an X10 source program using the C++ backend, invoke
"bin/x10c++ -MAIN_CLASS=<class_name> <class_name>.x10".  This will
produce an executable named "<class_name>" in the current
directory[*].

To run the compiled X10 executable in one place, invoke
"bin/runx10 ./<class_name>".
- To run in multiple places on Linux, run "bin/manager", and then
  invoke "bin/launcher -t <nplaces> ./<class_name>".
- To run in multiple places on AIX, run
  "LAPI_USE_SHMEM=yes poe ./<class_name> -procs <nplaces> -hostfile HOSTFILE".
  See "man poe" for additional options and the format of HOSTFILE.

[*] On Cygwin, the name will be "<class_name>.exe".  If there is
only one class with a "main" method, the -MAIN_CLASS argument may
be omitted, but the compiler will then produce an executable with
the default name ("a.out" on Unix, "a.exe" on Cygwin).

To speed up C++ compilation, use the -commandlineonly flag to make
the compiler only generate C++ code for the exact files specified
on the command line.  Note that this will cause the code for user
files not specified on the command line to not be generated, even
if they are in the sourcepath and are used to validate the files
that are specified.
