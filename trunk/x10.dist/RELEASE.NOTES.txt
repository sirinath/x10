Release 2.0.0

This release includes both the C++ and Java code generation backends.

There are several major language changes from X10 1.7 to 2.0. 
 - We have added structs to the language.  Structs provide a
   mechanism for defining headerless inlined aggregates.
   For an example of a struct, see x10.lang.Complex.
 - We have added the ability to declare val instance fields
   and instance methods of a class to be global. This means
   that the fields/methods can be accessed/invoked at any place.
 - We have eliminated Values from the language.  
   The combination of structs and global fields/methods cover all
   of the use cases for Values.
 - We have added static place type checking.
 - We have added unsigned integral types.
For more details on these and other minor language changes, please
see the language manual or the X10 2.0 tutorial found on x10-lang.org.

The following features described in the 2.0 language manual do not
currently work with the Java backend and will be fixed in the subsequent
releases:

- Non-static type definitions as class or interface members
  (static type defs do work)
- Type definitions as package members (i.e., in the outermost scope of
  a compilation unit)
- AST externalization to XML
- Shared local variables
- Extern methods

Additionally, the following features described in the 2.0 language
manual do not currently work with the C++ backend and will be fixed in
the subsequent releases:

- Garbage collection on Cygwin and AIX
- Generic virtual methods
- Exception stack traces on Cygwin and AIX

The generated C++ code requires g++ 4.2 or better to be compiled; 
we do almost all of our testing against g++ 4.3.2.  On AIX, you
may either use g++ 4.2 or better or xlC 10.01.0000.0003 or better.
