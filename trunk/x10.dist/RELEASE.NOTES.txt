Release 2.0.1

This release includes both the C++ and Java code generation backends.

LIST ANY LANGUAGE CHANGES SINCE 2.0.0 HERE

For more details on these and other minor language changes, please
see the language manual or the X10 2.0 tutorial found on x10-lang.org.

The following features described in the 2.0 language manual do not
currently work with the Java backend and will be fixed in the subsequent
releases:

- Non-static type definitions as class or interface members
  (static type defs do work)
- Type definitions as package members (i.e., in the outermost scope of
  a compilation unit)
- AST externalization to XML
- Shared local variables
- Extern methods

Additionally, the following features described in the 2.0 language
manual do not currently work with the C++ backend and will be fixed in
the subsequent releases:

- Garbage collection on Cygwin and AIX
- Generic virtual methods
- Exception stack traces on Cygwin and AIX

The generated C++ code requires g++ 4.2 or better to be compiled; 
we do almost all of our testing against g++ 4.3.2.  On AIX, you
may either use g++ 4.2 or better or xlC 10.01.0000.0004 or better.

Below is a summary of JIRA issues addressed for the X10 2.0.1 release.
