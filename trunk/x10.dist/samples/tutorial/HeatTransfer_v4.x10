/**
 * This is one of a series of programs showing how to express
 * different forms of parallelism in X10.</p>
 *
 * All of the example programs in the series are computing
 * the same thing:  solving a set of 2D partial differential
 * equations that can be expressed as an iterative 4-point
 * stencil operation.  See the X10 2.0 tutorial for
 * for more details and some pictures.</p>
 *
 * This program is illustrating an SPMD with all-to-all reduction
 * ("MPI-style").</p>
