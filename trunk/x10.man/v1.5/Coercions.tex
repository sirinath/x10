\XtenCurrVer{} supports the following conversions
promotions.

A {\em coercion} does not change object identity;
a coerced object may be explicitly coerced back to its original
type through a cast.

A {\em conversion} may change object identity.  A

\paragraph{Subtype coercion.}
A subtype may be implicitly coerced to any supertype.

\paragraph{Boxing conversion.}
A type \xcd"T" may be implicitly converted to the
boxed type \xcd"Box[T]".

\paragraph{Unboxing conversion.}
A boxed type \xcd"T" may be implicitly converted to the
type \xcd"T".

\paragraph{Widening numeric conversion.}
A numeric type may be implicitly converted to a wider
numeric type.
In particular, an implicit conversion may be performed between
a numeric type and a type to its right, below:
\begin{xten}
Byte < Short < Int < Long < Float < Double
Byte < Char < Int
\end{xten}

\paragraph{Narrowing conversion.}
A value class may be explicitly converted to any superclass.
This is a {\em narrowing conversion}.

\paragraph{String conversion.}
Any object that is an operand of the binary
\xcd"+" operator may
be converted to \xcd"String" if the other operand is a \xcd"String".
A conversion to \xcd"String" by invoking the \xcd"toString()"
method of the object.
