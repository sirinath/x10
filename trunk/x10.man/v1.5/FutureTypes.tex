\subsection{Future types}

For any type \xcd"T", \xcd"future[T]" is a type:
\begin{verbatim}
424   Type ::=   future [ Type ] 
\end{verbatim}
The type  represents a value which when forced will return a value of type
\xcd"T". Thus the type makes available the following methods:

\begin{xten}
  public def force(): T;
\end{xten}

%% Nothing to say about future/nullable yet.
