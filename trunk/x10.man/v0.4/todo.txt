* Check the latest changes to the syntax in mantis.
* Add a section about things that are yet to be worked out at the end,
  and work-arounds for them.
* Remote place types.
* Remove local annotation.
* Insert text about dynamic place checks, and place casts.
* Consider adding atomic expressions. Current work around is place the
  expression in an assignment. 

* Later date:
  * Add functions to the syntax.

* Need to define notion of hashCode for value classes. This cannot
  depend on the storage representation of course. And must be
  compatible with ==.

* Insert syntax statements for clock. XtenClocks.tex

2/17/2005
* Add section on native code. (done)
* Check Java Memory Model for input on ordering of atomics.
* Respond to Christoph' suggestion about atomic sections.
* Determine whether atomics can be general or not.
* Parallel I/O
* Array views, array sections (a la Fortran)
* Sparse regions.
* Operator overloading
* Generics
* Interface with Java.
* Introduction of immutable annotation on variables. Immutable
  variables can be initialized only once. Unlike final fields,
  immutable fields may be initialized after the constructor for the
  object has returned. Any attempt to assign an initialized immutable
  field will throw a runtime exception unless the value is equal to
  the value already stored in the field.
* Introduction of syntax for typestate assertions, for unaliased variables.
* Introduction of pure annotations on methods. Pure methods return the same
  value in any properly initialized heap (one in which all final fields
  have a value and those immutable fields that are read have a value). Such
  methods can read only immutable and final fields. Should they be allowed
  to initialize immutable heaps, and create new objects to be placed in 
  such a heap.
* Introduction of flow annotations on variables. A value in a flow
  variable cannot be communicated to old activities -- those that
  exist before this variable is created, or that are created by other
  activities. A value stored in a flow variable cannot be assigned to
  a field of a placelocal or placeglobal object. It can only be
  passed into methods, or returned from methods, or passed into
  created activities.

* Ensure that the array type constructor is equivariant. Cannot assign
  to a variable of type T[] an array of type S[] where S is a subtype
  of T.

* Add a comment about Cilk. async is closely related to spawn and
  finish to sync. X10 programs with "finish mains" generate
  series/parallel call graphs.

* Allow a method to be annotated with finish. This is the same as
  wrapping a finish around the body of the method. Hmm.. Need to allow
  an atomic to spawn an async as well. Then methods could be both
  finish and atomic. However, the finish must be outside the atomic.

* Thus X10 is changed to permit daemon threads.

* Fix the X10 clock spec so that clocked statements are correctly
  dealt with.


Grammar

o XtenOverview.tex.. fields typed at reference classes. Check the
  idiomatic expression here.
o s/he
o P 9... class F change m .. use this.a
o P 9 .. place P.. change to final place P.
p P 9 .. discuss how method invocation should be type-checked.
o P 10 ... ?T --> nullable T.
o P 10 ... last paragraph of col 1 on Page 10.
o Types.. A variable of a value data type {\tt R} where {\tt R} is the name of a
value class always holds a reference to an instance of {\tt R} (or a
class that is a subclass of {\tt R}) or an instance of {\tt R} (or a
class that is a subclass of {\tt R}). No program can distinguish
between the two cases.

o X10 support seven kinds of variable... Say something about clocked final variables, and how place/clock variables are just like other variables, but happen to be used in types.

o 3.6.2 ... used the phrase "variable declared at a type" a lot.
 class C {
  D x;
 }
So this text should discuss that u get an overflow. Compiler should detect
this and say something about it.

o Page 11. 3.7 ... == and != may communicate if the value is a value
  and its not local.

6/12/2004
o Need to respond to Kielstra note.
o Need to figure out whether annotations are to be allowed.

o Need to figure out whether enumerations are allowed. Can we just use
  JSR 201 here?
