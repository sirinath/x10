We have presented a simple design for constrained types
in \java-like languages. The design considerably enriches the space of
statically checkable types expressible in the language. This is
particularly important for data-structures such as lists and arrays.
We have formalized constrained types in a sound extension of FJ,
Constrained FJ.
Several examples of constrained types were presented.
Constrained types have been implemented in \Xten{}
and used for place types, clocked types, and array types.

In future work,
we plan to investigate
optimizations (such as array
bounds check elimination) enabled by constrained types.
We also plan to explore type inference for constrained types
and to pursue more expressive constraint systems and
extensions of constrained types for handling mutable state,
control flow, and effects.
