\chapter{Statements and Expressions}\label{XtenStatements}\index{statements}

\Xten{} inherits all the standard statements of \Java{}, with the expected semantics:

\begin{x10}
\em\tt EmptyStatement      LabeledStatement  
\em\tt ExpressionStatement IfStatement
\em\tt SwitchStatement     WhileDo
\em\tt DoWhile             ForLoop           
\em\tt BreakStatement      ContinueStatement  
\em\tt ReturnStatement   ThrowStatement
\em\tt TryStatement
\end{x10}

We focus on the new statements in \Xten. 


\section{Assignment}\index{assignment}\label{AssignmentStatement}

%It is often the case that an \Xten{} variable is assigned to only
%once. The user may declare such variables as {\cf final}. However,
%this is sometimes syntactically cumbersome.
%
%{}\Xten{} supports the syntax {\cf l := r} for assignment to mutable
%variables.  The user is strongly enouraged to use this syntax to
%assign variables that are intended to be assigned to more than
%once. The \Xten{} compiler may issue a warning if it detects code 
%that uses {\cf =} assignment statements on {\cf mutable} variables.

{}\Xten{} supports assignment {\tt l = r} to array variables. In this
case {\tt r} must have the same distribution {\tt D} as {\tt l}. This
statement involves control communication between the sites hosting
{\tt D}. Each site performs the assignment(s) of array components
locally. The assignment terminates when assignment has terminated at
all sites hosting {\tt D}.

%% TODO: Sectional assignment??

\section{Remote Method Invocation}\index{remote method invocation}
We introduce shorthand for asynchronous remote method invocation:

\begin{x10}
   o -> m(a1,...,ak)
\end{x10}
\noindent is taken as shorthand for one of

\begin{x10}
 async (o) \{o.m(a1,...,ak);\}
 future (o)\{o.m(a1, ..., ak);\}
\end{x10}
\noindent based on whether the return type of methodname is {\cf void}.

\section{Iteration}\index{foreach@{\tt foreach}}\label{ForLoop}
\index{for@{\tt for}}\label{ForAllLoop}

We introduce  $k$-dimensional versions of iteration operations {\cf for} and 
{\cf foreach}:

\begin{x10}
   foreach(ind1, ..., indk : R) \{S\}
\end{x10}

Here {\cf R} is a region.\footnote{We also permit {\cf R} to be a
distribution (array); in this case {\tt R} is taken to stand for {\tt
R.region} ({\tt R.distribution.region}).}  Let {\cf [T1,..., Tk]} be
the convex closure of the region.  Then the execution of this
statement results in the parallel execution of an activity

\begin{x10}
   \{ final T1 Ind1 = i1; 
     ...
     final Tk Indk = ik;
     S
   \}
\end{x10}
\noindent for each value {\cf [i1,\ldots, ik]} in the region. Note that
the number of activities is equal to the cardinality of the region,
not its convex closure. 

The syntax for the sequential iterator {\tt for} is the same as for
{\tt forall}. However each statement is executed in the same activity,
one after the other in canonical order.

In a similar fashion we introduce the syntax:\index{ateach@{\tt ateach}}

\begin{x10}
   ateach( Ind1, ..., Indk : A) \{S\}
\end{x10}

\noindent to stand for
\begin{x10}
   foreach (ind1, ..., indk : A) 
    async (A[ind1,...,indk]) \{S\}
\end{x10}

In method definitions, for a region {\tt R} we allow the syntax 
\begin{x10}
     R i1,...,ik; 
\end{x10} 

\noindent to introduce {\cf k} new parameters which range over the
component enumerations of the convex closure of {\cf R}.
