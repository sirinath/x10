Release 1.7.2

This release includes the C++ code generation backend.

This release of the Experimental Concurrent Programming Language (X10)
supports the following additional features (since Release 1.5):

- Generic classes and interfaces
- Function types and closures including methods with type parameters
- Type definitions
- Local type inference
- Scala-like syntax

Additionally, bug fixes have been made throughout the system.

The following features described in the 1.7 language manual do not
currently work with the Java backend and will be fixed in the subsequent
releases:

- Type parameters on closures
- Non-static type definitions as class or interface members
  (static type defs do work)
- Type definitions as package members (i.e., in the outermost scope of
  a compilation unit)
- AST externalization to XML
- Shared local variables
- Extern methods

Additionally, the following features described in the 1.7 language
manual do not currently work with the C++ backend and will be fixed in
the subsequent releases:

- Garbage collection
- Generic virtual methods
- Invocation of virtual methods from constructors
- Finally blocks that modify or access local variables
- Exception stack traces on Cygwin and AIX

Here's a list of known issues with the C++ backend:

- Default values are not assigned to some value types
- Static initialization is sometimes incorrectly ordered (at the moment
  it's very brittle, though somewhat controllable by the link order of
  files)
- Operator overloading does not work correctly sometimes
- Hash codes are not computed correctly for some classes
- Out of memory errors not thrown (an assertion is tripped instead)
- Code generation errors for value assignments and closures in generics
