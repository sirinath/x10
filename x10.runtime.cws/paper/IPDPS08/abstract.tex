  Graph problems are finding increasing applications in high
performance computing disciplines. Obtaining efficient
  implementations for large, irregular graph instances remains a challenge.
 There exisit a large body of theoretically fast parallel graph algorithms, however, 
 experimental studies show that they often times fail to achieve good parallel speedups 
 in practice as fine grained parallelism is not well supported on current system.
 In this paper we present the programming and runtime support of X10 that help 
 bridge the gap between theory and practice for large scale graph problems. X10 allows for
 elegant expression of all level of parallelism in graph algorithms, and provides efficient runtime 
 support for fast execution.

 We take the spaning tree problem as an example, and present. The problems we study represent a wide range of irregular problems that have fast
  theoretic parallel algorithms but no known efficient
  parallel implementations that achieve speedup without serious restricting assumptions about the inputs.
We believe our techniques will be of  practical impact in solving large-scale graph problems.
