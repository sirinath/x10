  Graph problems are finding increasing applications in high
performance computing disciplines. Obtaining efficient
  implementations for large, irregular graph instances remains a challenge.
 There exists a large body of theoretically fast parallel graph algorithms, however, 
 experimental studies show that they often times fail to achieve good parallel speedups 
 in practice as fine grained parallelism is not well supported on current system.
 In this paper we present the programming and runtime support of X10 that help 
 bridge the gap between theory and practice for large scale graph problems. X10 allows for
 elegant expression of parallelism of multiple levels, and provides efficient runtime 
 support for fast execution on parallel systems.

  We take spanning tree as an example, as it represents a wide range of graph problems that have fast
  theoretic parallel algorithms but no known efficient
  parallel implementations that achieve speedup without serious restricting assumptions about the inputs, 
  and present three algorithms expressed in X10. Our X10 implementation achieves better performance than 
  the Cilk implementation. For the graph traversal approach, the X10 implementation  beats the native 
  C implementation, demonstrating the productivity and performance advantage of the X10 programming model.
