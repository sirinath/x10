%% Frame X10. What is it, why should the reader care.

Since its inception, the field of computing has been dominated by the
{\em standard} model of computing. 

Architectural considerations necessitated parallel
processing. 

concurrency and scale.


X10 is the first language intended for performance and scale in the
post-MPI era.  

X10 is also remarkable in that it spans (successfully, we believe) two
distinct programming language traditions -- the old tradition of
statically linked languages such as Fortran, C, C++, and the more
modern tradition of dynamically-linked. VM based languages such as
Java, C\#, F\#.   This book is intended for the high performance
programmer working in the context of statically linked languages.


This book marks the end of the beginning. The APGAS model and the X10
model are defined and implemented.
