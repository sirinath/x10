Bard, add to the list of problems I should look at:

RA: random access aka "GUPS"

Otherwise, we are on the same page.

Thanks,

Jonathan

Chapter on Type System
Chapter on I/O
Chapter on Clocks - red-black thingies and systolic algorithms, cf. VJ's notes.

Important idioms/algorithms to consider for the prog guide:

* Parallel prefix - VJ's course
* Bounded and unbounded buffers - VJ's course
* Stream programming, using buffers - - VJ's course
* Selection; e.g., the median of a set of lots (a billion) numbers.  Rajesh
  Bordawekar = local expert.  VJ has the code somewhere too.
* Histogram problem (on a billion numbres) - VJ 2010 lecture 4 or 5
* Sparse and Dense Matrix stuff.  

What to Do If atomic/when are not fast enough
  (And often they won't be)
  * clocks
  * atomic objects
  * x10.lang.Semaphore
  > Note that 'when' spawns a thread, in the current impl.

PERCS RA and UTS benchmark
  UTS = unbalanced tree search. PPOPP 2011 paper by X10 team.  



------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* MontePi with Long.parse(args(0)) -- need 100000L, not 100000
* size() is just size

* do a no-numbered-include

* Write \ref{sec:forinloops}, about using Iterable[T] with for loops.

* HelloWorld - "copyright Greeters" is not shown in code.

* 'include line in text' gizmo. The "Hello World" example quotes the lines of
  the program one by one, and we should auto-do-that.

* line 1 of serial monte carlo: bulleted list (or enum), not indented text
  list.

* "Most of the time..." --- discuss <:
