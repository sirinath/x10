\subsection{Future types}

The interface \xcd"x10.lang.Future[T]"
is the type of all \xcd"future" expressions.
The type represents a value which when forced will return a value of type
\xcd"T". The interface makes available the following methods:

\begin{xten}
package x10.lang;
public interface Future[T] implements () => T {
  public def apply(): T;
  public def force(): T;
  public def forced(): Boolean;
}
\end{xten}
