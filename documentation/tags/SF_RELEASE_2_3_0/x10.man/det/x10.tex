\subsubsection{\code{sync}}

We introduce a new derivative synchronization concept, that of syncing.

We introduce \code{Runtime.sync()}. It returns only after all asyncs
spawned by the current activity have terminated or stopped at an
\code{advance} on a clock registered on the current activity.

Programs using finish/async/at/atomic/clocks/Runtime.sync() cannot deadlock.
