Why it's buggy:

\cite{Seo:2007:SBD:1522565.1522587}
a static pattern detection algorithm for identifying uninitialized field references
uninitialized field references
we identify 12 suspicious field references in the applications, and among those we find two suspected errors by manual inspection.



study and implementation:
Hardhat~\cite{Gil:2009:WRS:1615184.1615216}

enforced by~\cite{Hubert:2010:ESO:1888881.1888890} in a byte code verifier.
%Enforcing secure object initialization in java





Type systems to ensure safety:

Concurrency and initialization~\cite{Matsakis:2010:TTS:1869459.1869511}
%A time-aware type system for data-race protection and guaranteed initialization



Cyclic immutable structures:
Raw annotation by~\cite{Zibin:2010:OIG:1869459.1869509}


the default value has been replaced before
the first access to the field~\cite{Fahndrich:2007:EOI:1297027.1297052,XinQi:2009}.
track assignments to the fields of an object.
