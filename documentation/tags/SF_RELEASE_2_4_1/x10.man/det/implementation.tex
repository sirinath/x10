
Registration of accumulators with activities needs to be implemented
efficiently. This may require the implementation of an activity stack,
with registration information being looked up lazily and cached,
rather than pushed eagerly.  Also this information is clearly not
needed in the  body of async's that can be statically analyzed to not
contain accumulator operations.
