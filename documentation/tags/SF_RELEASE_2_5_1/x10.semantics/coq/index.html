<title>Coq mechanization of the semantics for Resilient X10</title>
</head>

<body>
<h1>Coq mechanization of the semantics for Resilient X10</h1>
<h2>by <a href="mailto:shinnar@us.ibm.com">Avi Shinnar</a></h2>
<p>This mechanization is meant as an accompaniment to the ECOOP 2014
paper(92): "Semantics of (Resilient) X10".</p>

<p>It contains the source files for a mechanization of the semantics
for Resilient X10, done in the semi-interactive theorem prover <a
href="http://coq.inria.fr/">Coq</a>.
</p>

<h2>Building</h2>
To build the source, <a href="http://coq.inria.fr/download">Coq 8.4pl3</a> is required.  This is available for a number of platforms, and can be obtained <a
href="http://coq.inria.fr/download">here</a>.

The proofs can be built (type-checked/verified) by running make.
This takes quite a while.  In particular, building CopyObj takes
multiple hours and over a gigabyte of memory (although the output is
only around 20MB).

Note that building simply verifies the proofs, and is not otherwise
required to understand the development.

<h2>Structure</h2>
Here we give a list of the files in the development, ordered bottom-up
(so dependencies are listed first), along with a description of
their content.
<ul>
  <li>Util
  <ul><li>Defines notations used throughout the development for lookup,
  update, and substitution.  To allow these notations to be reused for
  the corresponding concepts with multiple types, they are associated
  with typeclass operations.  Instances are then defined defined for appropriate
  types.</li>
  <li>Defines a typeclass for carrying the "StaticConfig"uration of
      the system: the number of PLACES, which must be non-zero.
      All the development is parameterized over the static
      configuration.
      To avoid some limitations of coq modules (such as the diamond problem), we do not use modules for this, but instead
      paramaterize everything in the rest of the development that
      needs it over the StaticConfig.  This is done implicitly, taking advantage
      of the normal typeclass mechanisms to find the appropriate
      configuration from the environment.
  </li>
  <li>Defines some useful tactics that are used in the development.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>ListUtil: defines many useful lemmas about lists (that are not
  part of the standard library).</li>
  <li>Assoc: defines many useful definitions and lemmas about
  association lists, particularly those with decidable equality for
  the keys.  This includes lookup and update operations, as well as
  the definition of a "compact" operation that removes entries with
  duplicate keys.</li>
  <li>Heap: Defines what it means to be a heap (as in memory, not as
  in the data structure).
  <ul>
    <li>A typeclass defines a finite heap with lookup, update, and
    new operations.  Additionally, the heap can be reasoned about using
    an association list model.</li>
    <li>For appropriate key and value types, we build an instance of
    the heap satisfying the required properties.</li>
    <li>Various derived definitions and lemmas about heaps are stated
    and proven.
    This includes a definition of heap inclusion, a partial order on heaps.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>ListVector
  <ul>
  <li>Defines bounded numbers: a dependent pair of a number and a
  proof that it is less than some bound.</li>
  <li>Defines a list_vector: a dependent pair of a list and a proof
  that the length of the list is equal to some bound.</li>
  <li>Defines lookup (nth) and update (replace_nth) functions over list vectors.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Value: defines the values of TX10 (and Resilient X10).  A value can be
  either an Object (reference), a GlobalObject (global reference), or
  a Nat (natural number).  GlobalObjects, and
  hence values, are parameterized over the number of PLACES (specified
  by the StaticConfig in the environment).  Equality of values is
  shown to be decidable.</li>
  <li>Auxiliary
  <ul>
    <li>Defines objects as a dependent pair of: a list of (field
    names, value) pairs, and
    a proof that the field names are all distinct.
    </li>
    <li>Using this, it builds a (local) heap instance whose keys are natural
    numbers (addresses) and values are objects.</li>
    <li>Defines a global heap as a partial map from places to local heaps.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
    <li>WfUtil: defines some well founded operations, useful for
  witnessing the termination of non-structurally recursive functions.</li>
  <li>Reachable: defines (local) reachability and associated
  definitions and properties.  A value v is reachable
  from another value/object, if v is part its (local) object graph.  Using
  reachability, we define (locally) well formed values as those whose object
  graph is all valid in the (local) heap (no dangling pointers).
  </li>
  <li>HeapIso: defines what it means for two values, in two different
  heaps, to be isomorphic.  This is first done by establishing what it
  means for a list of pairs of object ids to be an isomorphism between two heaps.
  Two references (object values) are isomorphic if they are a pair in
  an isomorphism.  Two valus/objects are isomorphic if their structurally
  corresponding references are isomorphic.
  <li>HeapIsoReach: contains lemmas about how isomorphism and
  reachability interact.</li>
  <li>CopyObj: This contains the definition of copy_obj, which copies
  the object graph rooted at an object from one heap to another heap.
  <p>
  This is done by traversing the source object graph while maintaining
  a map of previously found object ids.  Whenever an object id is
  encountered, if it is in the map, the previously created target
  object id is used.  Otherwise, a new object id is created in the
  target heap, and added to the mapping.  After recursively copying
  its children, the heap is updated so that the target object id
  points to the newly created copy.
  </p>
  <p>
  The difficulty with this is showing termination, since the algorithm
  given is not structurally recursive.  To see that it is well
  founded, we observe that at each recursive call, either the number
  of stored mappings increases, or the number of records left to process
  in the object decreases.  Since the number of object ids in the
  source heap is finite, we can rewrite the former condition as the number of
  unprocessed object ids, which decreases on each iteration (unless
  the latter measure decreases).  We put these two decreasing
  measures together to form a well founded measure, which verifies
  that the algorithm terminates.
  </p>
  <p>Reasoning about a function defined with a well-founded measure is
  very painful in Coq, since it is actually defined recursively on the
  accessibility structure derived from the proof of well foundedness.
  Unfolding and reasoning about this is hard.  Instead of trying to
  reason about its behavior after the fact, we give the
  copy_obj method a very strong dependent type, which encodes all the
  information we want to know.  In particular, it guarantees that
  the resulting object and heap satisfy all the expected heap
  isomorphism properties.
  </p>
  <p>Using this strong type requires that we embed proofs into our
  algorithm.  To simplify this, we use
  the <a href="http://coq.inria.fr/refman/Reference-Manual026.html">Program</a> extension to Coq, that allows us to put
  "holes" in our function definition.  These are turned into proof
  obligations that can then be discharged with tactics, as is usual
  for proofs.
  </p>
  <p>
   Unfortunately, this approach results in poor
   performance of the Coq type checker.  As a result, verifying this
   function takes several hours and over a gigabyte of memory.
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>CopyVal: Defines heap copy for values.  The heavy lifting/recursion is
      done by the previously defined copy_obj.  Calling copy_obj
      naively results in the type checker including the proof of
      copy_val, which results in poor performance.  To avoid this, the
      development uses a trick: the call to copy_obj is protected by a
      "lock", which is just the identity function, but constructed such
      that Coq will not unfold its definition automatically.

      <p>A successfully copied value is provably well-formed. Conversely, if an
      object cannot be copied, then it is provably not well-formed.
  Thus, a corollary of our definition of copy_obj is that value well-formedness is decidable.
  </p>
</li>

    <li>TransitionLabels: defines transition labels and various
  operations on them.  This includes a definition of copying a
  transition label (and its nested exception values) between
  heaps. </li>
  <li>Auxiliary2: assorted proofs about global heaps, well formedness, and
  copying.</li>
  <li>HeapEvolve: defines a notion of heap evolution.  A heap is an
  evolution of another heap if it contains all the object identifiers
  the first one does (and possibly more).  This is generalized to
  global heaps, wherein both global heaps have to be defined at the
  same places, and the corresponding heaps have to be (local)
  evolutions.</li>
  <li>HeapIsoReachExt: Some additional proofs that are not in
  HeapIsoReach to reduce the amount of times that copy_obj needs to be
  rebuilt.</li>
  <li>GloballyReachable: defines global reachability (as opposed to
  the local reachability defined in Reachable).  Global
  reachability traverses global references as well as (local)
  references.  Global well formedness is then defined for values, and
  the development closely parallels that found in Reachable.
  </li>

  <li>Expr
  <ul>
    <li>Defines the syntax of expressions in TX10 (and Resilient X10).
    </li>
    <li>Defines (capture-avoiding) substitution on expressions.
    </li>
    <li>Provides for the conversion of value expressions into values,
    and uses this to define toCompactVals, which builds an object from
    a list of (field name, value expression) pairs.
    </li>
    <li>Proves a stronger induction and recursion principle for
    expressions, which accounts for the nested recursion introduced
    by the New expression's nested expression list.
    </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Stmt
  <ul>
    <li>Defines the syntax of statements in TX10 (and Resilient X10).
    </li>
    <li>Defines (capture avoiding) substitution on statements.
    </li>
    <li>Defines isSync and isAsync as in the paper.
    </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>ListUtil2:  More proofs about lists.  These are
  separated out from Assoc so that CopyObj does not need to be
  re-compiled as frequently.</li>
  <li>Assoc2: More proofs about association lists.  These are
  separated out from Assoc so that CopyObj does not need to be
  re-compiled as frequently. </li>
  <li>ExprProps: properties of expressions.
   <ul>
    <li>Defines the free variables and "free" (explicit) values of an expression, and proves how they interact with substitution.
    </li>
    <li>Defines a complexity measure on expressions, and proves that
    it is preserved by substitution.
    </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>StmtProps: properties of statements.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Proves that isSync and isAsync are inverses.
    </li>
    <li>Defines the free variables and free values of a statement, and proves how they interact with substitution.
    </li>
    <li>Defines a complexity measure on statements, and proves that
    it is preserved by substitution.
    </li>
    <li>Defines what it means for a statement to be closed at the top
    level, as well as at every place changing statement, and states and
    proves lemmas about them.
    </li>
    <li>Defines the isDynamic predicate, which classifies the
    "dynamic" statements (dynamic at, dynamic async, and finish).
    </li>
    <li>
    Defines a recursive staticOnly predicate, which verifies that
    a statement does not contain any sub-statements that are dynamic.
    </li>
    <li>Defines "proper" statements, which only contain dynamic
    statements in "valid" spots.  This prohibits, for example, a Bind
    (let binding) statement from having any dynamic statements.  This
    is motivated by the semantics, which require the bind to be
    evaluated and substituted away before the sub-statement is
    evaluated.  Note that all staticOnly statements are proper.
    </li>
    <li> Defines a well formed statement as one that is both "proper"
    and closed (the statement must be closed at the top level and at
    every place changing statement).
  </ul>
  <li>Syntax: re-exports the syntax and properties of expressions and
  statements.  Simplifies the import lists of the subsequent development.
  </li>  
  <li>ExprSemantics: encodes the semantics of expressions in TX10 (and
  Resilient X10).</li>
  <li>EvalExprProps: States and proves properties of the expression
  semantics in TX10 (and Resilient X10).  This includes proofs that
  it is deterministic, total, and computable.  The transitive closure
  of the evaluation relation for expressions is also shown to be total and computable.</li>
  <li>Semantics: encodes the semantics of statements in TX10.</li>
  <li>ECtxt: defines an evaluation context for statements, and uses it
  to define a notion of sub-statement.</li>
  <li>EvalStmtProps: States and proves properties of the statement
  semantics.  This includes many of the properties in the paper,
  including a proof that the evaluation relation is total and
  computable (for well-formed inputs).  Since there are no loops or
  recursion in TX10, it also proves this for the transitive closure of
  the evaluation relation.</li>
  <li>ResilientSemantics: encodes the semantics of Resilient X10.</li>
  <li>ResilientSemanticsProps: States and proves properties of the statement
  semantics for Resilient X10.  This includes many of the properties in the paper,
  including a proof that the evaluation relation is total and
  computable (for well-formed inputs).  Since there are no loops or
  recursion in Resilient X10, it also proves this for the transitive closure of
  the evaluation relation.</li>
