This is the formalization of the resilient X10 semantics in Coq (http://coq.inria.fr/).

To "run", it requires that you have coq installed (http://coq.inria.fr/download).

Please obtain version >= 8.4pl2.

You can "compile" (and thereby verify) the proofs by running "make".  As is common, "make clean" cleans up generated files.

Warning: compiling CopyObj.v currently takes a few (>3) hours of 100% cpu utilization (using one core), and about a 1G of memory.

For more interactive viewing, you can use either CoqIDE (bundled with Coq) or proof-general (http://proofgeneral.inf.ed.ac.uk/) for emacs.
