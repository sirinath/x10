--------------------- Challenges

Java array mapping
  syntax?  x10 type?
  covariant arrays

Java primitive mapping
  are the types equivalent?  if not, what are the overloading rules?

Proposal:
  Java types as nested (native) types in an exposed X10 library class?
    class x10.interop.Java
    arrays: X[] -> Java.array[X]  (covariant!)
    primitives: Java.int (==x10.lang.Int?), Java.char (numeric!)
  Explicit conversion of primitives, arrays, strings via overloaded Java.convert() methods
  Implicit conversion for certain primitive types (e.g., Java.int<->Int) ?

Java classes in the typesystem (limited, !<: Any)
  read from class files
  in the same namespace as the X10 types (use FQNs or regular import)
  classpath rules
  what are the limitations on usage?
    no RTTs

Java types as type arguments to X10 generics
  Java types <: Any?  change typechecking?  split Any into Any and X10Any?
  Java types coercible to Any

Overloading on Java types vs. X10 types!

Name clashes between Java interface methods and X10 class/interface methods
  Same parameter types but different return type, e.g., toString()
  Can name mangle at code generation time, but need a solution for typechecking

X10 built-in structs as type argumnents to Java generics
  X10 boxed classes vs. Java boxed classes
  Mechanism for preventing those structs from being used as type arguments?

Mutable static fields?
  Java statics are per-JVM (=per-place?)

Java enums
  represented as classes?
  use in switches?

Overriding generic methods

Java locking/synchronization in X10 activities?


--------------------- Design summary

_Invoking Java from X10_

X10 users may use Java classes and interfaces by referencing their
fully-qualified names from the X10 program.  The classes will be read from
class files and integrated into the X10 type system.  Java classes do not
implement the x10.lang.Any interface, and thus are not required to have the
methods specified there, most notably typeName().  Their toString() returns
java.lang.String, not x10.lang.String (a different class).  However, Java
classes are coercible to x10.lang.Any, and the implementation wrapper takes
care of providing the default implementations of the methods of x10.lang.Any
and the implementation of == that preserves object identity.

<MT>
x10.lang.Any has the following methods.

    def toString():String;
    def typeName():String;
    def equals(that:Any):Boolean;
    def hashCode():Int;

Please note that x10.lang.{Int,Boolean,String,Any} are mapped to
int,boolean,java.lang.{String,Object} respectively.

If we consider the above mapping, we will see that the following methods of
x10.lang.Any directly correspond to the methods of java.lang.Object.

x10.lang.Any                             java.lang.Object
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
toString():x10.lang.String               java.lang.String toString()
equals(x10.lang.Any):x10.lang.Boolean    boolean equals(java.lang.Object)
hashCode():x10.lang.Int                  int hashCode()

For typeName():String, we can provide a default implementation as
this.getClass().getName() + "[x10.lang.Any, x10.lang.Any, ..., x10.lang.Any]".
For operations such as instanceof or cast, we can also provide default
implementations of $getRTT() and $getParam(int) by using Java reflection.

Therefore we don't see difficulties for making Java classes as subtype of x10.lang.Any.
</MT>

Java classes have X10 run-time types that can be retrieved using the Class
object.  They can be used as type arguments to X10 generic classes and
methods.

Java nested and inner classes may be accessed in the same manner as X10
nested/inner classes.  References to them will be written into the generated
code as-is, without being expanded by the inner class removal phase.
Java local and anonymous classes are not accessible.

For accessing primitive types and arrays, special nested types are provided in
a helper class x10.interop.Java.  That class also contains explicit conversion
methods that are always guaranteed to work.  There may be additional implicit
conversions to/from Java primitive types.  All manifestations of Java primitive
types in the Java APIs are via the nested types of x10.interop.Java, not X10
built-in types.

Java arrays are represented by an X10 generic class x10.interop.Java.array with
a covariant type parameter, to reflect the Java covariant array subtyping.
Java.array is the only generic class that accepts Java classes as type
arguments, and the only covariant generic.

An X10 class may implement a Java interface by defining methods with the
exact same signatures as the mapping of the interface to X10.  The signatures
of these methods will be written into the generated code in unmangled form
(possibly in addition to the mangled form needed for X10).  If implementing a
generic Java interface, boxed Java types have to be used explicitly in the
signatures (e.g., java.lang.Integer instead of x10.interop.Java.int).

Note that it is not possible for an X10 class to extend an existing Java class,
because all X10 classes must subclass x10.lang.Object.

<MT>
x10.lang.Object is mapped to interface x10.core.RefI. 
Although x10.core.RefI doesn't introduce additional methods over x10.core.Any,
all X10 classes including hand-written XRJ must implement x10.core.RefI (for
overloading Any and Object). But fortunately, since RefI is an interface,
we can create an X10 class by extending an existing Java class, by implementing
x10.core.RefI and providing proper implementations of the methods of x10.core.Any.
This is the way we create x10.core.concurrent.AtomicInteger by extending
java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger.
We can provide a wrapper class and delegate all methods to the wrapped Java object,
but wrapping is an overhead we should avoid across the boundary.
</MT>

To access a static field of a Java class or interface, the X10 user will simply
refer to it by name.  Static fields of Java classes are mutable.  Instance
fields of Java classes are accessible by name as well.  Java fields will be
written into the generated code in their unmangled form.

To invoke a method (static or instance) of a Java class or interface, the X10
user will refer to it by name, and it will be generated in its unmangled form.
The syntax for invoking a Java generic method is the same as for X10 generic
methods, but Java generic methods may hava type arguments that are Java classes
and interfaces.  We may initially disallow overriding Java generic methods with
X10 generic methods.  Since X10 classes cannot extend Java classes, super
method invocation is not an issue.

Constructing instances of Java classes has the same syntax as the corresponding
X10 idiom: "new C(a,b)".  These statements will be written into the generated
code as regular "new" statements with constructor arguments, and will not
undergo the expansion and rewriting that the X10 constructor invocations do.
Since X10 classes cannot extend Java classes, super constructor invocation is
not an issue.

To construct a Java array, the X10 user may construct an instance of
x10.interop.Java.array with the appropriate type argument.  If the type
argument is a Java primitive type, an array of primitives will be constructed.
There will also be helper methods in x10.interop.Java to construct
multi-dimensional arrays.  Routines will be provided to convert X10 arrays
(including array literals) into Java arrays.

Java classes that implement java.io.Serializable can captured by "at" -- their
X10-level serialization is the Java serialized form.  Attempting to capture
other Java classes will result in a run-time exception.


_Invoking X10 from Java_

All X10 classes will contain unmangled generated signatures of methods where
possible, in addition to the mangled forms needed for X10.  In case of
overloading on unsigned types, there will be an overloaded unmangled method in
the generated code that uses the boxed form of the unsigned type.  If two
methods with the same Java erasure are overloaded, the first one in program
order will be generated with an unmangled name.  Mangling scheme for the rest
is TBD.  X10 generic methods will take an extra argument per generic type
parameter.  The values of those arguments will be X10-level run-time types of
the type argument types.

Constraints are not exposed to the Java programmer at all -- they are
effectively erased from the signatures.  This includes method guards and type
guards.  The unmangled method generated above will also check the guard if
the source-level method has one.

All X10 constructors for non-generic classes will be exposed as Java
constructors with corresponding signatures (the default constructor used in X10
object allocation will take a dummy parameter).  Generic class constructors
will take one argument per class type parameter, prepended to the regular
argument list.  The values of those arguments will be X10-level run-time types
of the type argument types.

X10 structs (except built-in primitive ones) will be represented as Java
classes with unmangled names.  The above statement about constructors applies
to struct constructors.  The user may construct an instance of a struct using
the same "new" syntax used in Java.

The X10-level run-time types are available through the getRTT() helper method
in one of the runtime classes.  For X10-level instanceof and cast operations,
helper methods will be provided in the exposed RuntimeType object.

X10 primitive values will not be automatically boxed.  The Java programmer
would have to use the explicit overloaded $box()/$unbox() methods in one of the
helper classes in the X10 runtime.
