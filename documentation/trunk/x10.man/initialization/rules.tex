X10 is an advanced object-oriented language with a complex type-system
    and concurrency constructs.
This section describes how object initialization interacts with X10 features.
We begin with object-oriented features found in mainstream languages,
    such as constructors, inheritance, dynamic dispatching, exceptions, and inner classes.
We then proceed to X10's type-system features,
    such as constraints, properties, class invariants, closures, (non-erased) generics, and structs.
The parallel features of X10 allow writing concurrent code (using \code{finish} and \code{async}),
    and distributed code (using \code{at} and global references).
Next we describe the inter-procedural data-flow analysis that ensures that
    a field is read only after it was assigned.
Finally, we summarize the claims or properties of initialization in X10.


\subsection{Constructors and inheritance}
Inheritance is the first feature that interacts with initialization:
    when class \code{B} inherits from \code{A}
    then every instance of \code{B} has a sub-object that is like an instance of \code{A}.
When we initialize an instance of \code{B}, we must first initialize its \code{A} sub-object.
We do this in X10 by forcing the constructors of \code{B} to make a super call,
    i.e., call a constructor of \code{A}
    (either explicitly or implicitly).



\begin{figure}
\begin{lstlisting}
class A {
  val a:Int;
  def this() {
    LeakIt.foo(this); //err
    this.a = 1;
    val me = this; //err
    LeakIt.foo(me);
    this.m2(); // so m2 is implicitly non-escaping
  }
  // permitted to escape
  final def m1() {
    LeakIt.foo(this);
  }
  // implicitly non-escaping
  final def m2() {
    LeakIt.foo(this); //err
  }
  // explicitly non-escaping
  @NonEscaping final def m3() {
    LeakIt.foo(this); //err
  }
}
class B extends A {
  val b:Int;
  def this() {
    super();
    this.b = 2;
    super.m3();
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}

    \textbf{Definition of \emph{raw}:}
    {\this and \code{super} are \emph{raw} in {non-escaping} methods and in field initializers}.
    \textbf{Definition of \emph{non-escaping}:}
        {A method is \emph{non-escaping} if it is a constructor,
            or annotated with \code{@NonEscaping} or \code{@NoThisAccess},
            or a method that is called on a raw \this receiver}.
    \myrule{\arabic{Rule3}}{A raw \this or \code{super} cannot escape or be aliased}
    \myrule{\arabic{Rule4}}{A call on a raw \code{super} is allowed only for a \code{@NonEscaping} method}
    (\code{\textbf{final}} and \code{@NoThisAccess} are related
        to dynamic-dispatching as shown in \Ref{Figure}{Dynamic-dispatch}.)}
\label{Figure:Escaping-this}
\end{figure}

\Ref{Figure}{Escaping-this} shows X10 code that demonstrates the interaction
    between inheritance and initialization,
    and explains by example why leaking \this during construction can cause bugs.
In all the examples, errors issued by the X10 compiler are marked with \code{//err}.

We say that an object is \emph{raw} (also called partially initialized) before its constructor ends,
    and afterward it is \emph{cooked} (also called fully initialized).
Note that when an object is cooked, all its sub-objects must be cooked as well.
X10 prohibits any aliasing or leaking of \this during construction,
    therefore only \this or \code{super} can be raw (any other variable is definitely cooked).

Object initialization begins by invoking a constructor,
    denoted by the method definition \code{def this()}.
The first leak would cause a problem because field \code{a} was not assigned yet.
However, even after all the fields of \code{A} have been assigned,
    leaking is still a problem
    because fields in a subclass (field \code{b}) have not yet been initialized.
Note that leaking is not a problem if \this is not raw, e.g., in \code{m1()}.

We begin with two definitions:
    (i)~when an object is \emph{raw}, and
    (ii)~when a method is \emph{non-escaping}.
(i)~Variables \this and \code{super} are raw
    during the object's construction,
    i.e., in field initializers and in {non-escaping} methods
    (methods that cannot escape or leak \this).
(ii)~Obviously constructors are non-escaping,
    but you can also annotate methods \emph{explicitly} as \code{@NonEscaping},
    or they can be inferred to be \emph{implicitly} non-escaping
    if they are called on a raw \this receiver.

For example, \code{m2} is \emph{implicitly} non-escaping (and therefore cannot leak \this)
    because of the call to \code{m2}
    in the constructor.
The user could also mark \code{m2} \emph{explicitly} as non-escaping by using the annotation
    \code{@NonEscaping}.
(Like in Java, \code{@} is used for annotations in X10.)
We recommend to explicitly mark public methods as \code{@NonEscaping} to show intent,
    as done on method \code{m3}.
Without this annotation the call \code{super.m3()} in \code{B} would be illegal,
    due to rule~\userule{Rule4}.
(We could infer that \code{m3} must be non-escaping,
    but that would cause a dependency from a subclass to a superclass,
    which is not natural for people used to separate compilation.)
Finally, we note that all errors in this example are due to rule~\userule{Rule3}
    that prevents leaking a raw \this or \code{super}.




\subsection{Dynamic dispatch}
Dynamic dispatching interacts with initialization by transferring control to the subclass
    before the superclass completed its initialization.
\Ref{Figure}{Dynamic-dispatch} demonstrates why dynamic dispatching is error-prone during construction:
    calling \code{m1} in \code{A} would dynamically dispatch and
    call the implementation in \code{B}
    that would read the default value.



\begin{figure}
\begin{lstlisting}
abstract class A {
  val a:Int;
  def this() {
    this.a = m1(); //err1
    this.a = m2();
  }
  abstract def m1():Int;
  @NoThisAccess abstract def m2():Int;
}
class B extends A {
  var b:Int = 3;
  def this(i:Int) {
    super(i);
  }
  def m1() {
    val x = super.a;
    val y = this.b;
    return 1;
  }
  @NoThisAccess def m2() {
    val x = super.a; //err2
    val y = this.b; //err3
    return 2;
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}
\definerule{Rule5}
\definerule{Rule6}
\caption{Dynamic dispatching example.
    \myrule{\arabic{Rule5}}{A non-escaping method must be private or final, unless it has \code{@NoThisAccess}}
    \myrule{\arabic{Rule6}}{A method with \code{@NoThisAccess} cannot access \this or \code{super} (neither read nor write its fields)}
    }
\label{Figure:Dynamic-dispatch}
\end{figure}


X10 prevents dynamic dispatching by requiring that non-escaping methods
    must be private or final
    (so overriding is impossible).
For example, \code{\itshape err1} is caused by rule~\userule{Rule5}
    because \code{m1} is neither private nor final nor \code{@NoThisAccess}.

However, sometimes dynamic dispatching is required during construction.
For example, if a subclass needs to refine initialization
    of the superclass's fields.
Such refinement cannot have any access to \this, and therefore
    such methods are marked with \code{@NoThisAccess}.
For example, \code{\itshape err2} and \code{\itshape err3} are caused by rule~\userule{Rule6} that prohibits access \this or \code{super}
    when using \code{@NoThisAccess}.
\code{@NoThisAccess} prohibits any access to \this,
    however, one could still access the method parameters.
(If the subclass needs to read a certain field of the superclass that was previously assigned,
    then that field can be passed as an argument.) % to the \code{@NoThisAccess} method


In C++, the call to \code{m1} is legal,
    but at runtime
    methods are statically bound,
    so you will get an error for calling a pure virtual function.
In Java, the call to \code{m1} is also legal,
    but at runtime
    methods are dynamically bound,
    so the implementation of \code{m1} in \code{B}
    will read the default value of \code{a} and \code{b}.
%This behavior is undesired in Java,
%    and Java discourages it by trying to catch statically most of these cases.
%For example, Java prohibits calls to member functions before the super object was initialized,
%    as this example shows (which is also illegal in X10):
%\begin{lstlisting}
%class B extends A { B() {super(f()); }}
%\end{lstlisting}




\subsection{Exceptions}
Constructing an object may not always end normally,
    e.g., building a date object from an illegal date string should throw an exception.
Exceptions combined with inheritance interact with initialization in the following way:
    a cooked object must have cooked sub-objects,
    therefore if a constructor ends normally (thus returning a cooked object)
    then all preceding constructor calls (either \code{super(\ldots)} or \code{this(\ldots)})
    must end normally as well.
Phrased differently, in a constructor it should not be possible to
    recover from an exception thrown by a constructor call.
This is one of the reason why a constructor call must be the first statement in Java;
    failure to verify this led to a famous security attack~\cite{Dean:1996}.

\begin{figure}
\begin{lstlisting}
class B extends A {
  def this() {
    try { super(); } catch(Throwable e){} //err
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}
\definerule{Rule7}
\caption{Exceptions example:
    if a constructor ends normally (without throwing an exception),
        then all preceding constructor calls ended normally as well.
    \myrule{\arabic{Rule7}}{If a constructor does not call \code{super(\ldots)} or \code{this(\ldots)},
        then an implicit \code{super()} is added at the beginning of the constructor;
        the first statement in a constructor is a constructor call (either \code{super(\ldots)} or \code{this(\ldots)});
        a constructor call may only appear as the first statement in a constructor
        }
    }
\label{Figure:Exceptions}
\end{figure}


\Ref{Figure}{Exceptions} shows that it is an error to try to recover from an exception thrown
    by a constructor call;
    the reason is for the error is rule~\userule{Rule7} that requires the first statement to be \code{super()}.


\Subsection[Inner]{Inner classes}
Inner classes usually read the outer instance's fields during construction,
    e.g., a list iterator would read the list's header node.
Therefore, X10 requires that the outer instance is cooked,
    and prohibits creating an inner instance when the receiver is a raw \this.


\begin{figure}
\begin{lstlisting}
class Outer {
  val a:Int;
  def this() {
    // Outer.this is raw
    Outer.this. new Inner(); //err
    new Nested(); // ok
    a = 3;
  }
  class Inner {
    def this() {
      // Inner.this is raw, but
      // Outer.this is cooked
      val x = Outer.this.a;
    }
  }
  static class Nested {}
}
\end{lstlisting}
\definerule{Rule8}
\caption{Inner class example: the outer instance is always cooked.
    \myrule{\arabic{Rule8}}{a raw \this cannot be the receiver of \code{new}}
    }
\label{Figure:InnerClass}
\end{figure}

\Ref{Figure}{InnerClass} shows it is an error in X10 to create an inner instance
    if the outer is raw (from rule~\userule{Rule8}),
    but it is ok to create an instance of a static nested class,
    because it has no outer instance.

In fact, it is possible to view this rule as a special case to the rule that
    prohibits leaking a raw \this
    (because when you create an inner instance on a raw \this receiver,
    you created an alias,
    and now you have two raw objects: \code{Inner.this} and \code{Outer.this}).
We wish to keep the invariant that only one \this can be raw.

It is straightforward to convert inner classes into static nested classes
    by passing the outer instance explicitly as an argument to the inner class constructor.
To reduce complexity in the following subsections, we assume
    that such a transformation was done to convert all inner, anonymous and local classes into
    static nested classes.






We now turn our attention to X10's sophisticated type-system
    that has features that are not found in main-stream languages:
    constraints, properties, class invariants, closures, (non-erased) generics, and structs.

\subsection{Constraints and default/zero values}
X10 supports constrained types using the syntax \code{T\lb{}c\rb},
    where \code{c} is a boolean expression that can use final variables in scope,
    literals, properties (described below),
    the special keyword \code{self}
    that denotes the type itself,
    field access, equality (\code{==}) and disequality (\code{!=}).
There are plans to add arithmetic inequality (\code{<}, \code{<=})
    to X10 in the future,
    and it is possible to plugin any constraint solver into the X10 compiler.

As a consequence of constrained types,
    some types do not have a default value, e.g., \code{Int\lb self!=0\rb}.
Therefore, in X10, the fields of an object cannot be zero-initialized as done in Java.
Furthermore, in Java, a non-final field does not have to be assigned in a constructor
    because it is assumed to have an implicit zero initializer.
X10 follows the same line, and a non-final field is implicitly added a zero initializer
    \emph{if its type has-zero}.
\Ref{Figure}{Constraints} defines when a type \emph{has-zero},
    and gives examples of types without zero.
Note that \code{i0} has to be assigned because it is a final field (\code{val}),
    as opposed to \code{i1} which is non-final (\code{var}).

\begin{figure}
\begin{lstlisting}
class A {
  val i0:Int; //err
  var i1:Int;
  var i2:Int{self!=0}; //err
  var i3:Int{self!=0} = 3;
  var i4:Int{self==42}; //err
  var s1:String;
  var s2:String{self!=null}; //err
  var b1:Boolean;
  var b2:Boolean{self==true}; //err
}
\end{lstlisting}
\definerule{Rule10}
\caption{Default value example.
    \textbf{Definition of \emph{has-zero}:}
        {A type \emph{has-zero} if it contains the zero value
            (which is either \code{null}, \code{false}, 0, or
                zero in all fields for user-defined structs)
            or if it is a type parameter guarded with \code{haszero} (see \Ref{Section}{Generics-and-Structs}).}
    \myrule{\arabic{Rule10}}{A \code{var} field that lacks a field initializer and whose type has-zero,
        is implicitly added a zero initializer}
    }
\label{Figure:Constraints}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Properties and the class invariant}
Properties are final fields that can be used in constraints,
    e.g., \code{Array} has a \code{size} property,
    so an array of size 2 can be expressed as: \code{Array\lb self.size==2\rb}.
The differences between a property and a final field are both syntactically and semantically,
    as seen in class \code{A} of \Ref{Figure}{Properties}.
Syntactically, properties are defined after the class name,
    they must have a type and cannot have an initializer,
    and they must be initialized in a constructor using a property call statement written as \code{property(\ldots)}.
Semantically, properties are initialized before all other fields,
    and they can be used in constraints with the prefix \code{self}.

When using the prefix \this, you can access both properties and other final fields.
The difference between \this and \code{self} is
    shown in field \code{f3} in \Ref{Figure}{Properties}:
    \code{this.a} refers to the property \code{a} stored in \this,
    whereas \code{self.a} refers to \code{a} stored in the object to which \code{f3} refers.
(In the constructor, we indeed see that we assign to \code{f3} a new instance of \code{A}
    whose \code{a} property is equal to \code{this.a}.)

% Should I talk about interface and abstract property methods? Doesn't relate to initialization...

Properties must be initialized before other fields because
    field initializers and field types can refer to properties (see initializer for \code{f1} and the type of \code{f3}).
The super's fields can be accessed after the super call,
    and the other fields after the property call;
    field initializers are executed after the property call.

The \emph{class invariant} (\code{\lb{}b==a\rb} in \Ref{Figure}{Properties})
    may refer only to properties,
    and it must be satisfied after the property call.



\begin{figure}
\begin{lstlisting}
class A(a:Int) {
  def this(x:Int) {
    property(x);
  }
}
class B(b:Int) {b==a} extends A {
  val f1 = a+b;
  val f2:Int;
  val f3:A{this.a==self.a};
  def this(x:Int) {
    super(x);
    val i1 = a;
    val i2 = b; //err
    val i3 = f1; //err
    f2 = 2; //err
    property(x);
    f3 = new A(this.a);
  }
}

\caption{Properties and class invariant example:

    {If a class does not define any properties, then
        an implicit \code{property()} is added
        after (the implicit or explicit) \code{super(\ldots)}.}

        and the fields of \this can only be accessed after \code{property(\ldots)}}
    }
\label{Figure:Properties}
\end{figure}




\subsection{Closures}
Closures are functions that can refer to final variables in the enclosing scope,
    e.g., they can refer to final method parameters, locals, and \this.
When a closure refer to a variable, we say that it is captured by the closure,
    and the variable is thus stored in the closure object.

\begin{figure}
%    LeakIt.foo(closure1);
\begin{lstlisting}
class A {
  var a:Int = 3;
  def this() {
    val closure1 = ()=>this.a; //err
    at(here.next()) closure1();
    val local = this.a;
    val closure2 = ()=>local;
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}
\definerule{Rule20}
\caption{Closures example.
    \myrule{\arabic{Rule20}}{A closure cannot capture a raw \this}
    }
\label{Figure:Closures}
\end{figure}


\Ref{Figure}{Closures} shows why it is prohibited to capture a raw \this in a closure:
    that closure can later escape to another place which will serialize all captured variables
    (including the raw \this that should not be serialized, see \Ref{Section}{Multiple-Places}).
The work-around for using a field in a closure is to define a local that will refer only to the field (which is definitely cooked)
    and capture the local instead of the field as done in \code{closure2}.



\subsection{Generics and Structs}
\label{Section:Generics-and-Structs}
Structs in X10 ...
Does not contain \code{null}, so \code{haszero} ...

Generics are not unique to X10,
    however the combination of generics and the lack of default values for all types
    lead to new pitfalls.
In addition, generics in X10 are \emph{not} erased as in Java (therefore we cannot assign
    in order to make instantiations over structs efficient.

for example, \code{Box[Byte]} and \code{Box[Int]}
    would have the same size in Java but different sizes in X10.

\Ref{Figure}{Constraints} showed that a \code{var} must be assigned if
    it does not contain the zero value.
For generics, we added a \code{haszero} type condition that requires a type parameter to have the zero value.

\subsection{Claims about initialization in X10}
We assume we transformed all anonymous, local and inner classes into static nested classes
    as described in \Ref{Section}{Inner}.
Therefore we have only have a single \this variable.


* \this and \code{super} is the only accessible raw object (there could be several raw objects in the heap but only \this is accessible). Reason: \this cannot be aliased or leaked.
* only cooked objects cross places. Reason: \this is the only non-cooked object and it cannot have any aliases and it cannot cross an \code{at}.
* Only \code{@NoThisAccess} methods can be dynamically dispatched during construction. Reason: can only call private or final methods.
* all field writes finish by the time the ctor ends. Reason: data flow ensures that any write within an async has an enclosing finish.
* one cannot read an uninitialized field. Reason: reading from \this is verified by the data-flow alg of section~..., any other read is from a cooked object.
