\chapter{Deprecations}

X10 version 2.2 has a few relics of previous versions, code that is being used
by libraries but is not intended for general programming.    They should be
ignored.

These are: 

\begin{itemize}

\item \xcd`acc` variables. \index{acc}

\item The \xcd`offers` clause, as seen in the {\it Offers} nonterminal in the
      grammar (\ref{prod:Offers}).\index{offers}\index{Offers}

\item The grammar allows covariant and contravariant type parameters, marked
      by \xcd`+` and \xcd`-`: 
\begin{xtenmath}
class Variant[X, +Y, -Z] {}
\end{xtenmath}
      X10 does not support these in any other way.

\end{itemize}
