\section{Principles of X10 Objects}\label{XtenObjects}\index{object}
\index{class}

\subsection{Basic Design}

Objects are instances of classes: the most common and most powerful sort of
value in X10.  The other kinds of values, structs and functions, are more
specialized, better in some circumstances but not in all.
\xcd"x10.lang.Object" is the most general class; all other classes inherit
from it, directly or indirectly. 


Classes are structured in a single-inheritance code
hierarchy, may implement multiple interfaces, may have static and
instance fields, may have static and instance methods, may have
constructors, 
%% vj: We dont support initializers.
% may have static and instance initializers, 
may have static and instance nested classes and interfaces. \Xten{} does not
permit mutable static state.

\Xten{} objects do not have locks associated with them.
Programmers should use atomic blocks (\Sref{AtomicBlocks}) for mutual
exclusion and clocks (\Sref{XtenClocks}) for sequencing multiple parallel
operations.

An object exists in a single location: the place that it was created.  One
place cannot directly refer to an object in a different place.   A
special type, \Xcd{GlobalRef[T]}, allows explicit cross-place references. 

The basic operations on objects are:
\begin{itemize}

{}\item Field access (\Sref{FieldAccess}). 
The static and instance fields of an object can be retrieved; \xcd`var` fields
can be set.  
%%ACCUM%% Accumulator fields can be updated, but only in limited contexts. 

{}\item Method invocation (\Sref{MethodInvocation}).  
Static and instance methods of an object can be invoked.

{}\item Casting (\Sref{ClassCast}) and instance testing with \xcd`instanceof`
(\Sref{instanceOf}) Objects can be cast or type-tested.  

\item The equality operators \xcd"==" and \xcd"!="
Objects can be compared for equality with the \Xcd{==} operation.  This checks
object {\em identity}: two objects are \Xcd{==} iff they are the same object.

\end{itemize}

  
 
\subsection{Class Declaration Syntax}

The {\em class declaration} has a list of type \params, properties, a
constraint (the {\em class invariant}), a single superclass, zero or more
interfaces, and a class body containing the the definition of fields,
properties, methods, and member types. Each such declaration introduces a
class type (\Sref{ReferenceTypes}).

\section{Fields}
\label{FieldDefinitions}
\index{object!field}
\index{field}

Objects may have {\em instance fields}, or simply {\em fields} (called
``instance variables'' in C++ and Smalltalk, and ``slots'' in CLOS): places to
store data that is pertinent to the object. Fields, like variables, may be
mutable (\xcd`var`) or immutable (\xcd`val`) %%ACC%% , or accumulator
(\Xcd{acc}) .

Class may have {\em static fields}, which store data pertinent to the
entire class of objects.  
See \Sref{StaticInitialization} for more information.

No two fields of the same class may have the same name.

To avoid an ambiguity, it is a static error to invoke  a field with a function
type (\Sref{FunctionTypes}) that has 
the same name and signature  as a method of the same class.  
(Consider the class 
\begin{xten}
class Crash {
  val f : (Int) => Boolean = (Int)=>true;
  def f(Int) = false;
}
\end{xten}
\noindent
Then \xcd`crash.f(3)` might either mean ``call the function \xcd`crash.f` on
argument \xcd`3`'', or ``invoke the method \xcd`f` on argument \xcd`3`''.)

\subsection{Field Initialization}
\index{field!initialization}
\index{initialization!of field}

Fields may be given values via {\em field initialization expressions}:
\xcd`val f1 = E;` and \xcd`var f2 : Int = F;`. Other fields of \xcd`this` may
be referenced, but only those that {\em precede} the field being initialized.
For example, the following is correct, but would not be if the fields were
reversed:

%~~gen ^^^ Classes10
%package Classes_field_init_expr_a;
%~~vis
\begin{xten}
class Fld{
  val a = 1;
  val b = 2+a;
}
\end{xten}
%~~siv
%
%~~neg


\subsection{Field hiding}

A subclass that defines a field \xcd"f" hides any field \xcd"f"
declared in a superclass, regardless of their types.  The
superclass field \xcd"f" may be accessed within the body of
the subclass via the reference \xcd"super.f".

%~~gen ^^^ Classes20
% package classes.fields.primus;
%~~vis
\begin{xten}
class Super{ 
  val f = 1; 
}
class Sub extends Super {
  val f = true;
  def superf() : Int = super.f; // 1
}
\end{xten}
%~~siv
%
%~~neg

With inner classes, it is occasionally necessary to 
write \xcd`Cls.super.f` to get at a hidden field \xcd`f` of an outer class
\xcd`Cls`, as in 
%~~gen ^^^ Classes30
% package classes.fields.secundus; 
% NOTEST
%~~vis
\begin{xten}
class A {
   val f = 3;
}
class B extends A {
   val f = 4;
   class C extends B {
      // C is both a subclass and inner class of B
      val f = 5;
      def foo()
         = f          // 5
         + super.f    // 4
         + B.this.f   // 4 (the "f" of the outer instance)
         + B.super.f; // 3 (the "super.f" of the outer instance)
    }
}
\end{xten}
%~~siv
%
%~~neg


\subsection{Field qualifiers}
\label{FieldQualifier}
\index{qualifier!field}

The behavior of a field may be changed by a field qualifier, such as
\xcd`static` or \xcd`transient`.  


\subsubsection{\Xcd{static} qualifier}
\index{field!static}

A \xcd`val` field may be declared to be {\em static}, as described in
\Sref{FieldDefinitions}. 

\subsubsection{\Xcd{transient} Qualifier}
\label{TransientFields}
\index{transient}
\index{field!transient}

A field may be declared to be {\em transient}.  Transient fields are excluded
from the deep copying that happens when information is sent from place to
place in an \Xcd{at} statement.    The value of a transient field of a copied
object is the default value of its type, regardless of the value of the field
in the original.  If the type of a field has no
default value, it cannot be marked \Xcd{transient}.
%~~gen ^^^ Classes40
% package Classes.Transient.Example;
%~~vis
\begin{xten}
class Trans { 
   val copied = "copied";
   transient var transy : String = "a very long string";
   def example() {
      at (here) { // causes copying
         assert(this.copied.equals("copied"));
         assert(this.transy == null);
      }
   }
}
\end{xten}
%~~siv

%~~neg

\section{Properties}
\label{PropertiesInClasses}
\index{property}

The properties of an object (or struct) are  public \xcd`val` fields
usable at compile time in constraints.\footnote{In many cases, a 
\xcd`val` field can be upgraded to a \xcd`property`, which 
entails no compile-time or runtime cost.  Some cannot be, \eg, in cases where
cyclic structures of \xcd`val` fields are required.} 
For example,  every array has a \xcd`rank` telling
how many subscripts it takes.  User-defined classes can have whatever
properties are desired. 

Properties are defined in parentheses, after the name of the class.  They are
given values by the \xcd`property` command in constructors.
%~~gen ^^^ Classes50
% package Classes.Toss.Freedom.Disk2;
%~~vis
\begin{xten}
class Proper(t:Int) {
  def this(t:Int) {property(t);}
}
\end{xten}
%~~siv
%
%~~neg




\begin{staticrule*}
It is a compile-time error for a class
defining a property \xcd"x: T" to have an ancestor class that defines
a property with the name \xcd"x".  
\end{staticrule*}

A property \xcd`x:T` induces a field with the same name and type, 
as if defined with: 
%~~gen ^^^ Classes60
% package Classes.For.Masses.Of.NevermindTheRest;
% class Exampll[T] {
%~~vis
\begin{xten}
public val x : T;
\end{xten} 
%~~siv
% def this(y:T) { x=y; }
% }
%~~neg
\noindent It also defines a nullary getter method, 
%~~gen ^^^ Classes70
% package Classes_nullary_getter_a;
% class Exampllll[T] {
% public val x : T;
% def this(y:T) { x=y; }
%~~vis
\begin{xten}
public final def x()=x;
\end{xten}
%~~siv
%}
%~~neg

\noindent (As noted in \Sref{DepType:Interface}, interfaces can define
properties too. They define the same nullary getter methods, though they do
not require fields.)


\begin{staticrule*}
It is a compile-time error for a class or
interface defining a property \xcd"x :T" to have an existing method with
the signature \xcd"x(): T".
\end{staticrule*}


Properties are initialized by the invocation of a special \Xcd{property}
statement, which must be performed by each constructor of the class:
\begin{xten}
property(e1,..., en);
\end{xten}
The number and types of arguments to the \Xcd{property} statement must match
the number and types of the properties in the class declaration.  
Every constructor of a class with properties must invoke \xcd`property(...)`
precisely once; it is a static error if X10 cannot prove that this holds.

The requirement to use the \xcd`property` statement means that all properties
must be given values at the same time.  

By construction, the graph whose nodes are values and whose edges are
properties is acyclic.  \Eg, there cannot be values \xcd`a` and \xcd`b` with
properties \xcd`c` and \xcd`d` such that \xcd`a.c == b` and \xcd`b.d == a`.

\section{Methods}
\index{method}
\index{signature}
\index{method!signature}
\index{method!static}

As is common in object-oriented languages, objects can have {\em methods}, of
two sorts.  {\em Static methods} are functions, conceptually associated with a
class and defined in its namespace.  {\em Instance methods} are parameterized
code bodies associated with an instance of the class, which execute with
convenient access to that instance's fields. 

Each method has a {\em signature}, telling what arguments it accepts, what
type it returns, what precondition it requires. Method definitions may be
overridden by subclasses; the overriding definition may have a declared return
type that is a subtype of the return type of the definition being overridden.
Multiple methods with the same name but different signatures may be provided
on a class (called ``overloading'' or ``ad hoc polymorphism''). Methods may be
declared \Xcd{public}, \Xcd{private}, \Xcd{protected}, or given default package-level access
rights.

\subsection{Method Guards}
\label{MethodGuard}
\index{method!guard}
\index{guard!on method}

Often, a method will only make sense to invoke under certain
statically-determinable conditions.  For example, \xcd`example(x)` is only
well-defined when \xcd`x != null`, as \xcd`null.toString()` throws a null
pointer exception: 
%~~gen ^^^ Classes80
% package Classes.methodwithconstraintthingie;
% KNOWNFAIL
%~~vis
\begin{xten}
class Example {
   var f : String = "";
   def example(x:Object){x != null} = {
      this.f = x.toString();
   }
}
\end{xten}
%~~siv
%
%~~neg
\noindent
(We could have used a constrained type \xcd`Object{self!=null}` instead; in
most cases it is a matter of personal preference or convenience of expression
which one to use.) 

The requirement of having a method guard is that callers must demonstrate to
the X10
compiler that the guard is satisfied.  (As usual with static constraint
checking, there is no runtime cost.  Indeed, this code can be more efficient
than usual, as it is statically provable that \xcd`x != null`.)
This may require a cast: 
%~~gen ^^^ Classes90
% package Classes.methodguardnadacastthingie;
% KNOWNFAIL
% class Example {var f : String = ""; def example(x:Object){x != null} = {this.f = x.toString();}}
% class Eyample {
%~~vis
\begin{xten}
  def exam(e:Example, x:Object) {
    if (x != null) 
       e.example(x as Object{x != null});
    // WRONG: if (x != null) e.example(x);
  }
\end{xten}
%~~siv
%}
%~~neg

The guard \xcd`{c}` 
in a guarded method 
\xcd`def m(){c} = E;`
specifies a constraint \xcd"c" on the
properties of the class \xcd"C" on which the method is being defined. The
method exists only for those instances of \xcd"C" which satisfy \xcd"c".  It is
illegal for code to invoke the method on objects whose static type is
not a subtype of \xcd"C{c}".

\begin{staticrule*}
    The compiler checks that every method invocation
    \xcdmath"o.m(e$_1$, $\dots$, e$_n$)"
    is type correct. Each argument
    \xcdmath"e$_i$" must have a
    static type \xcdmath"S$_i$" that is a subtype of the declared type
    \xcdmath"T$_i$" for the $i$th
    argument of the method, and the conjunction of the constraints on the
    static types 
    of the arguments must entail the guard in the parameter list
    of the method.

    The compiler checks that in every method invocation
    \xcdmath"o.m(e$_1$, $\dots$, e$_n$)"
    the static type of \xcd"o", \xcd"S", is a subtype of \xcd"C{c}", where the method
    is defined in class \xcd"C" and the guard for \xcd"m" is equivalent to
    \xcd"c".

    Finally, if the declared return type of the method is
    \xcd"D{d}", the
    return type computed for the call is
    \xcdmath"D{a: S; x$_1$: S$_1$; $\dots$; x$_n$: S$_n$; d[a/this]}",
    where \xcd"a" is a new
    variable that does not occur in
    \xcdmath"d, S, S$_1$, $\dots$, S$_n$", and
    \xcdmath"x$_1$, $\dots$, x$_n$" are the formal
    parameters of the method.
\end{staticrule*}

\limitation{
Using a reference to an outer class, \xcd`Outer.this`, in a constraint, is not supported.
}


\subsection{Property methods}
\index{method!property}
\index{property method}

Property methods are methods that can be evaluated in constraints.  
For example, the \xcd`eq()` method below tells if the \xcd`x` and \xcd`y`
properties are equal; the \xcd`is(z)` method tells if they are both equal to
\xcd`z`.  These can be used in constraints, as illustrated in the
\xcd`example()` method.
%~~gen ^^^ Classes100
%package Classes.PropertyMethods;
%~~vis
\begin{xten}
class Example(x:Int, y:Int) {
   def this(x:Int, y:Int) { property(x,y); }
   property eq() = (x==y);
   property is(z:Int) = x==z && y==z;
   def example( a : Example{eq()}, b : Example{is(3)} ) {}
}
\end{xten}
%~~siv
%
%~~neg


A method declared with the modifier \xcd"property" may be used
in constraints.  A property method declared in a class must have
a body and must not be \xcd"void".  The body of the method must
consist of only a single \xcd"return" statement or a single
expression.  It is a static error if the expression cannot be
represented in the constraint system. 

The expression may contain invocations of other property methods. It is the
responsibility of the programmer to ensure that the evaluation of a property
terminates at compile-time, otherwise the type-checker will not terminate and
the program will fail to compile in a potentially most unfortunate way.

Property methods in classes are implicitly \xcd"final"; they cannot be
overridden.

A nullary property method definition may omit the formal parameters and
the \xcd"def" keyword.  That is, the following are equivalent:



%~~gen ^^^ Classes110
% package classes.waifsome1;
% class Waif(rect:Boolean, onePlace:Place, zeroBased:Boolean) {
%~~vis
\begin{xten}
property def rail(): Boolean = rect && onePlace == here && zeroBased;
\end{xten}
%~~siv
%}
%~~neg
and
%~~gen ^^^ Classes120
% package classes.waifsome2;
% class Waif(rect:Boolean, onePlace:Place, zeroBased:Boolean) {
%~~vis
\begin{xten}
property rail: Boolean = rect && onePlace == here && zeroBased;
\end{xten}
%~~siv
%}
%~~neg

Similarly, nullary property methods can be inspected in constraints without
\xcd`()`.  
%~~longexp~~`~~` ^^^ Classes130
% package classes.not.weasels;
% class Waif(rect:Boolean, onePlace:Place, zeroBased:Boolean) {
%   def this(rect:Boolean, onePlace:Place, zeroBased:Boolean)

\subsection{Method overloading, overriding, hiding, shadowing and obscuring}
\label{MethodOverload}
\index{method!overloading}

\noo{Here!}


The definitions of method overloading, overriding, hiding, shadowing
and obscuring in \Xten{} are the same as in \Java, modulo the following
considerations motivated by type parameters and dependent types.



Two or more methods of a class or interface may have the same
name if they have a different number of type parameters, or
they have formal parameters of different types.  \Eg, the following is legal: 

%~~gen ^^^ Classes150
% package Classes.Mful;
%~~vis
\begin{xten}
class Mful{
   def m() = 1;
   def m[T]() = 2;
   def m(x:Int) = 3;
   def m[T](x:Int) = 4;
}
\end{xten}
%~~siv
%
%~~neg

\XtenCurrVer{} does not permit overloading based on constraints. That is, the
following is {\em not} legal, although either method definition individually
is legal:
\begin{xten}
   def n(x:Int){x==1} = "one";
   def n(x:Int){x!=1} = "not";
\end{xten}


The definition of a method declaration \xcdmath"m$_1$" ``having the same signature
as'' a method declaration \xcdmath"m$_2$" involves identity of types. 

The {\em constraint erasure} of a type \xcdmath"T" is defined as follows.
The constraint erasure of  (a)~a class, interface or struct type \xcdmath"T" is 
\xcdmath"T"; (b)~a type \xcdmath"T{c}" is the constraint erasure of 
\xcdmath"T"; (b)~a type \xcdmath"T[S$_1$,$\ldots$,S$_n$]" 
is \xcdmath"T'[S$_1$',$\ldots$,S$_n$']" where each primed type is the erasure of 
the corresponding unprimed type.
 Two methods are said to have {\em the
  same signature} if (a) they have the same number of type parameters,
(b) they have the same number of formal (value) parameters, and (c)
for each formal parameter the constraint erasure of its types are equivalent. It is a
compile-time error for there to be two methods with the same name and
same signature in a class (either defined in that class or in a
superclass).

\begin{staticrule*}
  A class \xcd"C" may not have two declarations for a method named \xcd"m"---either
  defined at \xcd"C" or inherited:
\begin{xtenmath}
def m[X$_1$, $\dots$, X$_m$](v$_1$: T$_1$, $\dots$, v$_n$: T$_n$){tc}: T {...}
def m[X$_1$, $\dots$, X$_m$](v$_1$: S$_1$, $\dots$, v$_n$: S$_n$){sc}: S {...}
\end{xtenmath}
\noindent
if it is the case that the constraint erasures of the types \xcdmath"T$_1$",
\dots, \xcdmath"T$_n$" are
equivalent to the constraint erasures of the types \xcdmath"S$_1$, $\dots$, T$_n$"
respectively.
\end{staticrule*}

In addition, the guard of a overriding method must be 
no stronger than the guard of the overridden method.   This
ensures that any virtual call to the method
satisfies the guard of the callee.

\begin{staticrule*}
  If a class \xcd"C" overrides a method of a class or interface
  \xcd"B", the guard of the method in \xcd"B" must entail
  the guard of the method in \xcd"C".
\end{staticrule*}

A class \xcd"C" inherits from its direct superclass and superinterfaces all
their methods visible according to the access modifiers
of the superclass/superinterfaces that are not hidden or overridden. A method \xcdmath"M$_1$" in a class
\xcd"C" overrides
a method \xcdmath"M$_2$" in a superclass \xcd"D" if
\xcdmath"M$_1$" and \xcdmath"M$_2$" have the same signature with constraints erased.
Methods are overriden on a signature-by-signature basis.

\section{Constructors}
\index{constructor}

Instances of classes are created by the \xcd`new` expression: \\
%##(ClassInstCreationExp
\begin{bbgrammar}
%(FROM #(prod:ClassInstCreationExp)#)
ClassInstCreationExp \: \xcd"new" TypeName TypeArguments\opt \xcd"(" ArgumentList\opt \xcd")" ClassBody\opt & (\ref{prod:ClassInstCreationExp}) \\
                    \| \xcd"new" TypeName \xcd"[" Type \xcd"]" \xcd"[" ArgumentList\opt \xcd"]" \\
                    \| Primary \xcd"." \xcd"new" Id TypeArguments\opt \xcd"(" ArgumentList\opt \xcd")" ClassBody\opt \\
                    \| AmbiguousName \xcd"." \xcd"new" Id TypeArguments\opt \xcd"(" ArgumentList\opt \xcd")" ClassBody\opt \\
\end{bbgrammar}
%##)

This constructs a new object, and calls some code, called a {\em constructor},
to initialize the newly-created object properly.

Constructors are defined like methods, except that they are named \xcd`this`
and ordinary methods may not be.    The content of a constructor body has
certain capabilities (\eg, \xcd`val` fields of the object may be initialized)
and certain restrictions (\eg, most methods cannot be called); see
\Sref{ObjectInitialization} for the details.

The following class provides two constructors.  The unary constructor 
\xcd`def this(b : Int)` allows initialization of the \xcd`a` field to an 
arbitrary value.  The nullary constructor \xcd`def this()` gives it a default
value of 10.  The \xcd`example` method illustrates both of these calls.

\begin{ex}
%~~gen ^^^ ClassesCtor10
% package ClassesCtor10;
%~~vis
\begin{xten}
class C {
  public val a : Int;
  def this(b : Int) { a = b; } 
  def this() { a = 10; }
  static def example() {
     val two = new C(2);
     assert two.a == 2;
     val ten = new C(); 
     assert ten.a == 10;
  }
}
\end{xten}
%~~siv
%
%~~neg
\end{ex}

\subsection{Automatic Generation of Constructors}
\index{constructor!generated}

Classes that have no constructors written in the class declaration are
automatically given a constructor which sets the class properties and does
nothing else. If this automatically-generated constructor is not valid (\eg,
if the class has \xcd`val` fields that need to be initialized in a
constructor), the class has no constructor, which is a static error.

\begin{eg}
The following class has no explicit constructor.   

%~~gen ^^^ ClassesCtor20
% package ClassesCtor20;
%~~vis
\begin{xten}
class C(x:Int) {
  static def example() {
    val c : C = new C(4);
    assert c.x == 4;
  }
}
\end{xten}
%~~siv
%
%~~neg

%~~gen ^^^ ClassCtor30_MustFailCompile
% NOCOMPILE
%~~vis
\begin{xten}
class C(x:Int) {
  val d: Int;
  static def example() {
    val thisShouldBeWrong = new C(40);
  }
}
\end{xten}
%~~siv
%
%~~neg


Thus, it has an implicit constructor: 
\xcd`def this(x:Int){property(x);}`
\end{eg}

\subsection{Calling Other Constructors}

The {\em first} statement of a constructor body may be a call of the form 
\xcd`this(a,b,c)` or \xcd`super(a,b,c)`.  The former will execute the body of
the matching constructor of the current class; the latter, of the superclass. 
This allows a measure of abstraction in constructor definitions; one may be
defined in terms of another.

\begin{ex}
The following class has two constructors.  \xcd`new Ctors(123)` constructs a
new \xcd`Ctors` object with parameter 123.  \xcd`new Ctors()` constructs one
whose parameter has a default value of 100: 
%~~gen ^^^ Classes5q6q
% package Classes5q6q;
%~~vis
\begin{xten}
class Ctors {
  val a : Int;
  def this(a:Int) { this.a = a; }
  def this() {
    this(100);
  }
}
\end{xten}
%~~siv
%
%~~neg
\end{ex}

In the case of a class which implements \xcd`operator ()` 
--- or any other constructor and application with the same signature --- 
this can be ambiguous.  If \xcd`this()` appears as the first statement of a
constructor body, it could, in principle, mean either a constructor call or an
operator evaluation.   This ambiguity is resolved so that \xcd`this()` always
means the constructor invocation.  If, for some reason, it is necessary to
invoke an application operator early in a constructor, precede it with a dummy
statement, such as \xcd`if(false);`  

\section{Static initialization}
\label{StaticInitialization}
\index{initialization!static}
The \Xten{} runtime implements the following procedure to ensure
reliable initialization of the static state of classes.


Execution commences with a single thread executing the
\emph{initialization} phase of an \Xten{} computation at place \Xcd{0}. This
phase must complete successfully before the body of the \Xcd{main} method is
executed.

The initialization phase must be thought of as if it is implemented in
the following fashion: (The implementation may do something more
efficient as long as it is faithful to this semantics.)

\begin{xten}
Within the scope of a new finish
for every static field f of every class C 
   (with type T and initializer e):
async {
  val l = e; 
  ateach (Dist.makeUnique()) {
     assign l to the static f field of 
         the local C class object;
     mark the f field of the local C 
         class object as initialized;
  }
}
\end{xten}

During this phase, any read of a static field \Xcd{C.f} (where \Xcd{f} is of type \Xcd{T})
is replaced by a call to the method \Xcd{C.read\_f():T} defined on class \Xcd{C}
as follows

\begin{xten}
def read_f():T {
   when (initialized(C.f)){};
   return C.f;
}
\end{xten}
 

If all these activities terminate normally, all static fields have values of
their declared types, 
and the \Xcd{finish} terminates normally. If
any activity throws an exception, the \Xcd{finish} throws an
exception. Since no user code is executing which can catch exceptions
thrown by the finish, such exceptions are printed on the console, and
computation aborts.

If the activities deadlock, the implementation deadlocks.

In all cases, the main method is executed only once all static fields
have been initialized correctly.

Since static state is immutable and is replicated to all places via 
the initialization phase as described above, it can be accessed from
any place.



\section{User-Defined Operators}
\label{sect:operators}
\index{operator}
\index{operator!user-defined}

It is often convenient to have methods named by symbols rather than words.
For example, suppose that we wish to define a \xcd`Poly` class of
polynomials -- for the sake of illustration, single-variable polynomials with
\xcd`Int` coefficients.  It would be very nice to be able to manipulate these
polynomials by the usual operations: \xcd`+` to add, \xcd`*` to multiply,
\xcd`-` to subtract, and \xcd`p(x)` to compute the value of the polynomial at
argument \xcd`x`.  We would like to write code thus: 
%~~gen ^^^ Classes160

% // Integer-coefficient polynomials of one variable.

%   public val coeff : Array[Int](1);

The operator-using code can be written in X10, though a few variations are
necessary to handle such exotic cases as \xcd`1+X`.

Most X10 operators can be given definitions.\footnote{Indeed, even for the
standard types, these operators are defined in the library.  Not even as basic
an operation as integer addition is built into the language.  Conversely, if
you define a full-featured numeric type, it will have most of the privileges that
the standard ones enjoy.  The missing priveleges are (1) literals; (2) 
the \xcd`..` operator won't compute the \xcd`zeroBased` and \xcd`rail`
properties as it does for \xcd`Int` ranges; (3) \xcd`*` won't track ranks, as
it does for \xcd`Region`s; 
(4) \xcd`&&` and \xcd`||` won't short-circuit, as they do for \xcd`Boolean`s, 
 and (5) \xcd`a==b` will only coincide with
\xcd`a.equals(b)` if coded that way.  For example, a \xcd`Polar` type might
have many representations for the origin, as radius 0 and any angle; these
will be \xcd`equals()`, but will not be \xcd`==`.}  However, \xcd`&&` and
\xcd`||` 
are only short-circuiting for \xcd`Boolean` expressions; user-defined versions
of these operators have no special execution behavior.  
These are: \\
\begin{tabular}{l}

postfix \xcd`()`\\
\xcd`as T`\\
unary \xcd`-`, unary \xcd`+`, \xcd`!`, \xcd`~`\\

\subsection{Binary Operators}

Defining the sum \xcd`P+Q` of two polynomials looks much like a method
definition.  It uses the \xcd`operator` keyword instead of \xcd`def`, and
\xcd`this` appears in the definition in the place that a \xcd`Poly` would
appear in a use of the operator.  So, 
\xcd`operator this + (p:Poly)` explains how to add \xcd`this` to a
\xcd`Poly` value.

However, we want to allow the sum of an integer and a polynomial as well:
\xcd`3+P`.  It would be quite inconvenient to have to define this as a method
on \xcd`Int`; changing \xcd`Int` is far outside of normal coding.  So, we
allow it as a method on \xcd`Poly` as well.

Furthermore, it is sometimes convenient to express a binary operation as a
static method on a class. 
The definition for the sum of two

%##)
When X10 attempts to typecheck a binary operator expression like \xcd`P+Q`, it
first typechecks \xcd`P` and \xcd`Q`. Then, it looks for operator declarations
for \xcd`+` in the types of \xcd`P` and \xcd`Q`. If there are none, it is a
static error. If there is precisely one, that one will be used. If there are
several, X10 looks for a {\em best-matching} operation, \viz{} one which does
not require the operands to be converted to another type. For example,
\xcd`operator this + (n:Long)` and \xcd`operator this + (n:Int)` both apply to
\xcd`p+1`, because \xcd`1` can be converted from an \xcd`Int` to a \xcd`Long`.
However, the \xcd`Int` version will be chosen because it does not require a
conversion. If even the best-matching operation is not uniquely determined,
the compiler will report a static error.

The main difference between expressing a binary operation as an instance
method (with a \xcd`this` in the definition) and a static one (no \xcd`this`)
is that instance methods don't apply any conversions, while static methods
attempt to convert both arguments. 




\subsection{Unary Operators}

Unary operators are defined in a similar way, with \xcd`this` appearing in the
\xcd`operator` definition where an actual value would occur in a unary
expression.  The operator to negate a polynomial is: 

%~~gen ^^^ Classes220
% package Classes.In.Poly106;
% class Poly {
%   public val coeff : Array[Int](1);
%   public def this(coeff: Array[Int](1)) { this.coeff = coeff;}
%   public def degree() = coeff.size()-1;
%   public def  a(i:Int) = (i<0 || i>this.degree()) ? 0 : coeff(i);
%~~vis
\begin{xten}
  public operator - this = new Poly(
    new Array[Int](coeff.size(), (i:Int) => -coeff(i))
    );
\end{xten}
%~~siv
%   def makeSureItWorks() {
%      val x = new Poly([0,1]);
%      val p <: Poly = -x;
%   }
% }
%~~neg

The rules for typechecking a unary operation are the same as for methods; the
complexities of binary operations are not needed.

\subsection{Type Conversions}

Explicit type conversions, \xcd`e as T{c}`, can be defined as operators on
class \xcd`T`.

\subsection{Implicit Type Coercions}
\index{type conversion!implicit}

You may also define {\em implicit} type coercions to \xcd`T{c}` as static
operators in class \xcd`T`.  The syntax for this is
\xcd`static operator (x:U) : T{c} = e`.
Implicit coercions are used automatically by the compiler on method calls 
(\Sref{sect:MethodResolution}) and assignments (\Sref{domedomedome}).

With the {\tt -STATIC\_CALLS} compiler flag disabled, additional coercions come
into play.
\noo{explain}

For example, we can define an implicit coercion from \xcd`Int` to \xcd`Poly`,
and avoid having to define the sum of an integer and a polynomial
as many special cases.  In the following example, we only define \xcd`+` on
two polynomials (using a \xcd`static` operator, so that implicit coercions
will be used -- they would not be for an instance method operator).  The
calculation \xcd`1+x` coerces \xcd`1` to a polynomial and uses polynomial
addition to add it to \xcd`x`.

\label{set-and-apply}
X10 allows types to implement the subscripting / function application
operator, and indexed assignment.  The \xcd`Array`-like classes take advantage
of both of these in \xcd`a(i) = a(i) + 1`.  

\xcd`a(b,c,d)`
is an operator call, to an operator defined with 
\xcd`public operator this(b:B, c:C, d:D)`.  It may be overloaded.
For
example, an ordered dictionary structure could allow subscripting by numbers
with \xcd`public operator this(i:Int)`, and by string-valued keys with 
\xcd`public operator this(s:String)`.  


\xcd`a(i,j)=b` is an \xcd`operator` as well, with zero or more indices
\xcd`i,j`.  It may also be overloaded. 

The update operations \xcd`a(i) += b` are defined to be the 
same as the corresponding \xcd`a(i) = a(i) + b`.  This applies for all arities
of arguments, and all types.  Of course to use this, both the application and
assignment \xcd`operator`s must be defined.




The \xcd`Oddvec` class of somewhat peculiar vectors illustrates this.
\xcd`a()` returns a string representation of the oddvec, which probably should
be done by \xcd`toString()` instead.  
\xcd`a(i)` picks out one of the three
coordinates of \xcd`a`, which is sensible.  
\xcd`a()=b` sets all the coordinates of \xcd`a` to \xcd`b`.
\xcd`a(i)=b` assigns to one of the
coordinates.  \xcd`a(i,j)=b` assigns different values to \xcd`a(i)` and
\xcd`a(j)`, purely for the sake of the example.

\section{Class Guards and Invariants}\label{DepType:ClassGuard}
\index{type invariants}
\index{class invariants}
\index{invariant!type}
\index{invariant!class}
\index{guard}


Classes (and structs and interfaces) may specify a {\em class guard}, a
constraint which must hold on all values of the class.    In the following
example, a \xcd`Line` is defined by two distinct \xcd`Pt`s\footnote{We use \xcd`Pt`
to avoid any possible confusion with the built-in class \xcd`Point`.}
%~~gen ^^^ Classes260
% package classes.guards.invariants.glurp;

\begin{xten}
class Pt(x:Int, y:Int){}
class Line(a:Pt, b:Pt){a != b} {}
\end{xten}
%~~siv
%
%~~neg

In most cases the class guard could be phrased as a type constraint on a property of
the class instead, if preferred.  Arguably, a symmetric constraint like two
points being different is better expressed as a class guard, rather than
asymmetrically as a constraint on one type: 
%~~gen ^^^ Classes270
% package classes.guards.invariants.glurp2;

\label{DepType:TypeInvariant}
\index{class invariant}
\index{invariant!class}
\index{class!invariant}
\label{DepType:ClassGuardDef}



With every defined class, struct,  or interface \xcd"T" we associate a {\em type
invariant} $\mathit{inv}($\xcd"T"$)$, which describes the guarantees on the
properties of values of type \xcd`T`.  

Every value of \xcd`T` satisfies $\mathit{inv}($\xcd"T"$)$ at all times.  This
is somewhat stronger than the concept of type invariant in most languages
(which only requires that the invariant holds when no method calls are
active).  X10 invariants only concern properties, which are immutable; thus,
once established, they cannot be falsified.

The type
invariant associated with \xcd"x10.lang.Any"
is 
\xcd"true".

The type invariant associated with any interface or struct \xcd"I" that extends
interfaces \xcdmath"I$_1$, $\dots$, I$_k$" and defines properties
\xcdmath"x$_1$: P$_1$, $\dots$, x$_n$: P$_n$" and
specifies a guard \xcd"c" is given by:

\begin{xtenmath}
$\mathit{inv}$(I$_1$) && $\dots$ && $\mathit{inv}$(I$_k$) 
    && self.x$_1$ instanceof P$_1$ &&  $\dots$ &&  self.x$_n$ instanceof P$_n$ 
    && c  
\end{xtenmath}

Similarly the type invariant associated with any class \xcd"C" that
implements interfaces \xcdmath"I$_1$, $\dots$, I$_k$",
extends class \xcd"D" and defines properties
\xcdmath"x$_1$: P$_1$, $\dots$, x$_n$: P$_n$" and
specifies a guard \xcd"c" is
given by the same thing with the invariant of the superclass \xcd`D` conjoined:
\begin{xtenmath}
$\mathit{inv}$(I$_1$) && $\dots$ && $\mathit{inv}$(I$_k$) 
    && self.x$_1$ instanceof P$_1$ &&  $\dots$ &&  self.x$_n$ instanceof P$_n$ 
    && c  
    && $\mathit{inv}$(D)
\end{xtenmath}


Note that the type invariant associated with a class entails the type
invariants of each interface that it implements (directly or indirectly), and
the type invariant of each ancestor class.
It is guaranteed that for any variable \xcd"v" of
type \xcd"T{c}" (where \xcd"T" is an interface name or a class name) the only
objects \xcd"o" that may be stored in \xcd"v" are such that \xcd"o" satisfies
$\mathit{inv}(\mbox{\xcd"T"}[\mbox{\xcd"o"}/\mbox{\xcd"this"}])
\wedge \mbox{\xcd"c"}[\mbox{\xcd"o"}/\mbox{\xcd"self"}]$.



\subsection{Invariants for {\tt implements} and {\tt extends} clauses}\label{DepType:Implements}
\label{DepType:Extends}
\index{type-checking!implements clause}
\index{type-checking!extends clause}
\index{implements}
\index{extends}
Consider a class definition
\begin{xtenmath}
$\mbox{\emph{ClassModifiers}}^{\mbox{?}}$
class C(x$_1$: P$_1$, $\dots$, x$_n$: P$_n$) extends D{d}
   implements I$_1${c$_1$}, $\dots$, I$_k${c$_k$}
$\mbox{\emph{ClassBody}}$
\end{xtenmath}

Each of the following static semantics rules must be satisfied:

\begin{staticrule}{Int-implements}
The type invariant \xcdmath"$\mathit{inv}$(C)" of \xcd"C" must entail
\xcdmath"c$_i$[this/self]" for each $i$ in $\{1, \dots, k\}$
\end{staticrule}

\begin{staticrule}{Super-extends}
The return type \xcd"c" of each constructor in a class \xcd`C`
must entail the invariant \xcdmath"$\mathit{inv}$(C)".
\end{staticrule}

\subsection{Invariants and constructor definitions}
\index{invariant!and constructor}
\index{constructor!and invariant}

A constructor for a class \xcd"C" is guaranteed to return an object of the
class on successful termination. This object must satisfy  \xcdmath"$\mathit{inv}$(C)", the
class invariant associated with \xcd"C" (\Sref{DepType:TypeInvariant}).
However,
often the objects returned by a constructor may satisfy {\em stronger}
properties than the class invariant. \Xten{}'s dependent type system
permits these extra properties to be asserted with the constructor in
the form of a constrained type (the ``return type'' of the constructor):

%##(CtorDecl
\begin{bbgrammar}
%(FROM #(prod:CtorDecl)#)
            CtorDecl \: Mods\opt \xcd"def" \xcd"this" TypeParams\opt FormalParams WhereClause\opt HasResultType\opt Offers\opt CtorBody & (\ref{prod:CtorDecl}) \\
\end{bbgrammar}
%##)

\label{ConstructorGuard}

The parameter list for the constructor
may specify a \emph{guard} that is to be satisfied by the parameters
to the list.

\begin{example}
%%TODO--rewrite this
Here is another example, constructed as a simplified 
version of \Xcd{x10.array.Region}.  The \xcd`mockUnion` method 
has the type that a true \xcd`union` method would have.

%~~gen ^^^ Classes280
%package Classes.SimplifiedRegion;
%~~vis
\begin{xten}
class MyRegion(rank:Int) {
  static type MyRegion(n:Int)=MyRegion{rank==n};
  def this(r:Int):MyRegion(r) {
    property(r);
  }
  def this(diag:Array[Int](1)):MyRegion(diag.size){ 
    property(diag.size);
  }
  def mockUnion(r:MyRegion(rank)):MyRegion(rank) = this;
  def example() {
    val R1 : MyRegion(3) = new MyRegion([4,4,4]); 
    val R2 : MyRegion(3) = new MyRegion([5,4,1]); 
    val R3 = R1.mockUnion(R2); // inferred type MyRegion(3)
  }
}
\end{xten}
%~~siv
%
%~~neg
The first constructor returns the empty region of rank \Xcd{r}.  The
second constructor takes a \Xcd{Array[Int](1)} of arbitrary length
\Xcd{n} and returns a \Xcd{MyRegion(n)} (intended to represent the set
of points in the rectangular parallelopiped between the origin and the
\Xcd{diag}.)

The code in \xcd`example` typechecks, and \xcd`R3`'s type is inferred as
\xcd`MyRegion(3)`.  


\end{example}

\begin{staticrule}{Super-invoke}
   Let \xcd"C" be a class with properties
   \xcdmath"p$_1$: P$_1$, $\dots$, p$_n$: P$_n$", invariant \xcd"c"
   extending the constrained type \xcd"D{d}" (where \xcd"D" is the name of a class).

   For every constructor in \xcd"C" the compiler checks that the call to
   super invokes a constructor for \xcd"D" whose return type is strong enough
   to entail \xcd"d". Specifically, if the call to super is of the form 
     \xcdmath"super(e$_1$, $\dots$, e$_k$)"
   and the static type of each expression \xcdmath"e$_i$" is
   \xcdmath"S$_i$", and the invocation
   is statically resolved to a constructor
\xcdmath"def this(x$_1$: T$_1$, $\dots$, x$_k$: T$_k$){c}: D{d$_1$}"
   then it must be the case that 
\begin{xtenmath}
x$_1$: S$_1$, $\dots$, x$_i$: S$_i$ $\vdash$ x$_i$: T$_i$  (for $i \in \{1, \dots, k\}$)
x$_1$: S$_1$, $\dots$, x$_k$: S$_k$ $\vdash$ c  
d$_1$[a/self], x$_1$: S$_1$, ..., x$_k$: S$_k$ $\vdash$ d[a/self]      
\end{xtenmath}
\noindent where \xcd"a" is a constant that does not appear in 
\xcdmath"x$_1$: S$_1$ $\wedge$ ... $\wedge$ x$_k$: S$_k$".
\end{staticrule}

\begin{staticrule}{Constructor return}
   The compiler checks that every constructor for \xcd"C" ensures that
   the properties \xcdmath"p$_1$,..., p$_n$" are initialized with values which satisfy
   \xcdmath"t(C)", and its own return type \xcd"c'" as follows.  In each constructor, the
   compiler checks that the static types \xcdmath"T$_i$" of the expressions \xcdmath"e$_i$"
   assigned to \xcdmath"p$_i$" are such that the following is
   true:
\begin{xtenmath}
p$_1$: T$_1$, $\dots$, p$_n$: T$_n$ $\vdash$ t(C) $\wedge$ c'     
\end{xtenmath}
\end{staticrule}
(Note that for the assignment of \xcdmath"e$_i$" to \xcdmath"p$_i$"
to be type-correct it must be the
    case that \xcdmath"p$_i$: T$_i$ $\wedge$ p$_i$: P$_i$".) 


\begin{staticrule}{Constructor invocation}
The compiler must check that every invocation \xcdmath"C(e$_1$, $\dots$, e$_n$)" to a
constructor is type correct: each argument \xcdmath"e$_i$" must have a static type
that is a subtype of the declared type \xcdmath"T$_i$" for the $i$th
argument of the
constructor, and the conjunction of static types of the argument must
entail the constraint in the parameter list of the constructor.
\end{staticrule}
