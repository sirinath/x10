XtenDistribution{s}

A distribution is a mapping from an XtenRegion to the set of places. Each program runs in a fixed number of places, determined  by runtime parameters. The static constant place.MAX_PLACES specifies the maximum number of places. The collection of places is assumed to be totally ordered.

When operated on as a distribution, a region R implicitly behaves as the distribution mapping each item in R to "here".

    region R = [100]
    distribution D = R block N;
    distribution D = R cycle N;
    distribution D = R here;
    distribution D = R random N;

The distribution "R block N" distributes the elements of R (in order) over the set of places in blocks of size N, starting with the first place and wrapping around if there are still elements in R. Similarly for cycle. The distribution R random N randomly allocates N-sized blocks of points in R to places.

X10 will allow for user-defined distributions, and for composition of distributions.

Distributions may be dense or sparse.

Random thoughts.

Need to be able to specify various properties of distributions and regions, when specifying them as generic parameters.

e.g.

   Dimensionality of the distribution.
   Whether the distribution is square or not?
   Triangular?
   Enumeration subrange on a dimension.
   That a dimension is 0..N+1 (here N is always positive).
