\Xten{} is a class-based object-oriented language
that provides both dependent and generic types.
The language has a sequential core similar to Java or Scala, but
also
constructs for concurrency and distribution.

A key feature that interacts with generics is that the type
system provides both reference types and value types.
An instance of a reference type is an object on the
heap.  All reference types are subclasses of \xcd"Object".
Variables of reference type may be \xcd"null".
In contrast, an instance of a value type might be represented in
unboxed form on the call stack
and can never be \xcd"null".
Ideally, the design should support instantiation of generics on both 
reference and value types.

This section describes the design of generics for \Xten,
including several alternative designs.  These alternatives
demonstrate the expressiveness of constrained kinds.

%to support traits in a future version of the language.}
\todo{emph interactions with data constraints}

\subsection{Type constraints}

To permit genericity, variables \Xcd{X} must be admitted over types.
The choice of type variables is discussed below.  We assume here
that classes have a means of introducing new type variables
either as type parameters or as type members.
For instance,
the class \xcd"List" introduces a type variable \xcd"X"
representing the list's element type.

\Xten already supports constraints over values, so it is natural
to extend these to constraints over types.
Here, we ask: how should type variables be constrained?

Constraints occur in several places in the \Xten syntax.  They
are of course permitted in constrained types \xcd"C{c}".
Constraints may also be used as \emph{class invariants}, 
which are constraints on the class's properties and other
final variables in scope.
The class invariant must be established by the class's
constructor and subsequently holds for all instances of the
class.

Methods and constructors
may also have constraints, or \emph{guards}, on their parameters.
A guard must be satisfied by the caller of the method and
will hold throughout its body.  Type constraints used in the
method guard restrict the types of the arguments or of the method
receiver.  

\subsubsection{Nominal subtyping and equality constraints}

In class-based OO languages such as Java,
types are equipped with a partial
order (the \emph{subtyping} order) generated from the user program
through the ``\Xcd{extends}'' relationship.  
This motivates a very natural constraint system on types.  For a type
variable \Xcd{X} we should be able to assert the constraint
\Xcd{X}~$\extends$~\Xcd{T}: a valuation (mapping from variables to types) realizes
this constraint if it maps \Xcd{X} to a type that extends \Xcd{T}.
Constraints on types can specify either subtype (\xcd"<="),
supertype (\xcd">="), or equality bounds (\xcd"==").

Using subtyping constraints in the class invariant provides a
means to bound the type variables introduced by the class
declaration.  Constraints in constrained types
\xcd"C{c}", can bound
type-valued members of the base type \xcd"C".

These constraints also can be used in method guards.
This feature is similar to optional methods in CLU~\cite{clu} and to generalized type constraints in C$\sharp$~\cite{emir06}.
For instance, given a list of \xcd"T", one could define a
method \xcd"print" with a guard that requires that \xcd"T" be a
subtype of \xcd"Printable":
\begin{xtenmathnoindent}
  def print(){T <= Printable} {
    head.print();
    tail.print();
  }
\end{xtenmathnoindent}
This constraint ensures that the \xcd"head" field of type
\xcd"T" has a \xcd"print()" method.

\subsubsection{Structural constraints}

One should also
be able to require that a type have a
particular member---a field with a given name and type, or a method
with a given name and signature.
We introduce the constraints 
\Xcd{T} \Xcd{has} \Xcd{f:T} and \Xcd{T} \Xcd{has}
\Xcdmath{m($\tbar{x}\ty\tbar{S}$):T} to express this.
These
constraints allow one to define an alternative version of the
\xcd"print" methods above  as:
\begin{xtenmathnoindent}
  def print(){T has print(): void} {
    head.print();
    tail.print();
  }
\end{xtenmathnoindent}
Rather than restricting the actual receiver to lists whose
element type implements \xcd"Printable", with structural
constraints, any list whose element type has a \xcd"print"
method may be used.
\eat{
This feature makes it easier to integrate
third-party libraries, where interface names might not be
compatible.
}

Structural constraints on types are found in many languages.
For instance,
Haskell supports type
classes~\cite{haskell,haskell-type-classes}.
%
%ML's module system allows modules to be constrained by
%structural signatures~\cite{ml}.
In Modula-3, type equivalence is structural
rather than nominal as in object-oriented languages of the C
family (e.g., C++, Java, and \Xten{}).
Unity~\cite{malayeriIntegrating08}
is a Java-like language with both nominal and structural subtyping.

In the class invariant, a structural constraint can bound the
class's type variables, similarly to 
the language PolyJ~\cite{java-popl97}, which allows type
parameters to be
bounded using
structural \emph{where clauses}~\cite{where-clauses}.
For example, a sorted list class
could be written as follows in PolyJ:
{
\begin{xtennoindent}
class SortedList[T] where T {int compareTo(T)} {
  void add(T x) {... x.compareTo(y) ...}
  ...
}
\end{xtennoindent}}
The \xcd"where" clause states that the type parameter
\xcd"T" must have a
method \xcd"compareTo" with the given signature.
\xcd"SortedList" can be instantiated on any type
that provides the method.
With nominal bounds, \xcd"SortedList" could only require that
its parameters implement an interface such as \xcd"Comparable".

\subsubsection{Default values}

Recall that \Xten's type system provides both reference types and value
types.
In languages like Java with
primitive types, every type has a default value---\xcd"null" for
reference types, \xcd"false" or \xcd"0" for primitive
types---used to initialize arrays of that type.
In \Xten, some types do not have an obvious default value.  For example,
\xcd"int{self>0}" does not contain the value \xcd"0".
Consequently, a useful constraint is \xcd"T has default", which
holds if the type \xcd"T" has a default value.

\subsubsection{{\tt instanceof} constraints}

Lastly, we consider constraints of the form \xcd"x" \xcd"instanceof" \xcd"T".
By relating types and values in a single constraint, 
these constraints provide considerable expressive power.
For instance, 
consider the class declaration:
\begin{xtennoindent}
class C {
  def equals[T](x:T) {this instanceof T} = (this==x);
}
\end{xtennoindent}
The \xcd"equals" method can be called with any object
that is a supertype of \xcd"C".

\xcd"instanceof" constraints can be used to build intersection
types, e.g., \xcd"Object{self instanceof A,self instanceof B}"
should be a subtype of \xcd"A" and \xcd"B"..

\subsection{Type variables}
\label{sec:type-properties}
\label{sec:variance}

Languages such as Java~\cite{Java3} and
Scala~\cite{scala} introduce \emph{type parameters} on classes
and methods.
An alternative approach, used by BETA~\cite{beta}, 
Scala~\cite{scala}, and other languages is, to use type members.
In \Xten, one can
generalize properties to include type-valued properties:
A \emph{type property}
is a final object member initialized at construction time with a
concrete type.  

\subsubsection{Type properties}

\label{sec:usability}
\label{sec:parameters-vs-fields}

Like normal value properties, type properties
can be used in constrained types through the variable \xcd"self".
%
This immediately suggests use-site variance
constraints~\cite{unifying-genericity,variant-parametric-types}
on type properties.
The type of a list of integers, say, can be written as
\xcd"List{self.T==int}".  
Nominal subtyping constraints, then, may be used to
provide use-site variance constraints.
%
Consider the following subtypes of \xcd"List" with type property
\xcd"T":
\begin{itemize}
\item \xcd"List".  This type has no constraints on the type
property \xcd"T".
Any type that constrains \xcd"T"
is a subtype of \xcd"List".
\eat{
The type \xcd"List" is equivalent to \xcd"List{true}".
%
For a \xcd"List" \xcd"v", the return type of the \xcd"get" method
is \xcd"v.T".
Since the property \xcd"T" is unconstrained,
the caller can only assign the return value of \xcd"get"
to a variable of type \xcd"v.T".
}

\item \xcd"List{T==float}".
The type property \xcd"T" is bound to \xcd"float".
For a final expression \xcd"v" of this type,
\xcd"v.T" and \xcd"float" are equivalent types and can be used
interchangeably.

\item \xcdmath"List{T$\extends$Collection}".
This type constrains \xcd"T" to be a subtype of \xcd"Collection".
All instances of this type must bind \xcd"T" to a subtype of
\xcd"Collection"; for example \xcd"List[Set]" (i.e.,
\xcd"List{T==Set}") is a subtype of
\xcdmath"List{T$\extends$Collection}" because \xcd"T==Set" entails
\xcdmath"T$\extends$Collection".

\item \xcdmath"List{T$\super$String}".  This type bounds the type property
\xcd"T"
from below. 
\end{itemize}

While expressive,
type properties have a number of usability issues.
The key difference between type parameters and type properties
is that type properties are
instance \emph{members} bound during object construction.  Type
properties are thus accessible through expressions---\xcd"e.T" is
a legal type (if \xcd"e" is final)---and are inherited by subclasses.
These features give type properties more expressive power than
type parameters, as we shall describe below; however, because they 
provide similar functionality with often subtle distinctions,
type properties can be difficult to use, especially for novices,
and require more care in the design.
For instance,
since type properties are inherited,
the language design needs
to account for ambiguities introduced when the same name is
used for different type properties declared in or inherited into a class.

\eat{
Inheriting type properties may also lead to confusion
As an example, in the following hypothetical code extended with
type properties (declared as normal properties with the ``type''
\xcd"*"),
\xcd"HashMap"  inherits the properties \xcd"K" and \xcd"V" from
\xcd"AbstractMap".
\begin{xten}
class AbstractMap(K:*, V:*) {
  abstract def get(K): V;
  abstract def put(K, V): V;
}

class HashMap implements Map {
  def get(k: K): V = ...;
  def put(k: K, v: V): V = ...;
}
\end{xten}
A user more familiar with type parameters might declare
\xcd"HashMap" as follows:
\begin{xten}
class HashMap(K:*,V:*) implements Map(K,V) {
  def get(k: K): V = ...;
  def put(k: K, v: V): V = ...;
}
\end{xten}
This declaration would introduce a new pair of type properties
named \xcd"K" and
\xcd"V" that shadow the inherited properties.
A na{\"\i}ve implementation of type properties would store run-time
type information for all four properties in each instance
of \xcd"HashMap".
}

\paragraph{\normalfont\bf\em Virtual types.}

Type properties provide expressive power much like 
\emph{virtual
types}~\cite{beta,mp89-virtual-classes,ernst06-virtual};
moreover, they can also
be constrained at the use-site,
can be refined on a per-object basis without explicit subclassing,
and can be refined contravariantly as well as covariantly.

Thorup~\cite{thorup97}
proposed adding genericity to Java using virtual types.  For example,
a generic \xcd"List" class can be written as follows:
{
\begin{xten}
abstract class List {
  abstract typedef T;
  T get(int i) { ... }
}
\end{xten}}
\noindent
The virtual type \xcd"T" is unbound in \xcd"List", but 
can be refined by binding \xcd"T" in a subclass:
{
\begin{xten}
abstract class NumberList extends List {
  abstract typedef T as Number;
}
class IntList extends NumberList {
  final typedef T as Integer;
}
\end{xten}}
\noindent
Only classes where \xcd"T" is final bound, such as \xcd"IntList",
can be non-abstract.  Scala~\cite{scala} supports abstract types
and virtual types in a similar way.
%
The analogous definition of 
\xcd"List" in \Xten{} using type properties is as follows:
{
\begin{xten}
class List(T:*) {
  def get(i: int): T { ... }
}
\end{xten}}

\noindent
Unlike the virtual-type version,
the \Xten{} version of \xcd"List" is not abstract;
\xcd"T" need not be instantiated by a subclass because it can be
instantiated (constrained) on a per-object basis.
Rather than declaring subclasses of \xcd"List",
one uses the constrained subtypes
\xcdmath"List{T$\extends$Number}" and \xcd"List{T==Integer}".

Type properties can also be refined contravariantly.
For instance, one can write the type \xcdmath"List{T$\super$Integer}".

\paragraph{Self types.}

Type properties can also be used to support a form of self
type~\cite{bruce-binary,bsg95}.
%
Self types can be implemented by introducing a
type property \Xcd{type} to the root of the class hierarchy,
\Xcd{Object}:
\begin{xtenmath}
class Object(type:*){type <= Object} { $\dots$ }
\end{xtenmath}

\noindent
For any final path expression \Xcd{p}, the type
$\Xcd{p}.\Xcd{type}$ represents all instances of the fixed,
but statically unknown, run-time class referred to by \Xcd{p}.
Scala's path-dependent types~\cite{scala} and J\&'s
dependent classes~\cite{nqm06}
take a similar approach.

Self types are achieved by
constraining types so that if a path expression \Xcd{p}
has type \Xcd{C}, then
$\Xcd{p}.\Xcd{type} \subtype \Xcd{C}$.
In particular, one can add the class invariant
$\Xcd{this}.\Xcd{type} \subtype \Xcd{C}$ to every class \Xcd{C}.
This invariant ensures that
$\Xcd{this}.\Xcd{type}$ is a subtype
of the lexically enclosing class.

The property must be initialized to the given class, so, without
further language support, one must create an instance of
\xcd"Object" with \xcd"new" \xcd"Object(Object)" to initialize
the \xcd"type" property.

\subsubsection{Type parameters}

Most OO languages provide genericity through type parameters on
classes and methods.  The development of a nominal OO type
system with type parameters is now standard (cf.  FGJ~\cite{FJ}).

Scala~\cite{scala} supports definition-site variance
annotations:
a parameter may be declared in-, co-, or
contravariant.
If the parameter \xcd"X" of a class \xcd"C" is covariant,
then \xcd"S" a subtype of
\xcd"T" implies  \xcd"C[S]" is a subtype of \xcd"C[T]".
Similarly, if \xcd"X" is contravariant,
\xcd"C[T]" is a subtype of \xcd"C[S]".
Invariant parameters are the default; a covariant parameter is
declared by prepending ``\xcd"+"'' to the parameter name in the
class header; a contravariant parameter is declared by
prepending ``\xcd"-"''.  The usage of variant parameter types in
the body of their class must be
restricted to ensure the subtyping relation holds.

Java, by contrast, supports use-site variance through wildcards.
This has a number of usability problems~\cite{wildcards-are-evil},
which also occur with constrained type properties, above.

\subsection{Overloading and dispatch}

The next question to address is the overloading semantics for
methods with constraints on formal parameters and with method
guards.  This issue was considered in non-generic \Xten but was
revisited in light of type constraints.

One option is to ignore constraints when checking for
overloading.  This means that \xcd"m(int{self==0})" and
\xcd"m(int{self==1})", for instance, are considered to have the
same signature; if both occur within the same class, a
compile-time error occurs.

Another option is to allow the
overloading: methods are resolved at compile-time, based on the
constraints.  It is an error if a call could resolve to more
than one method.  One question is whether to rule out overlapping
methods (e.g., \xcd"m(int{self>=0})" and \xcd"m(int{self==1})"),
or to permit them and have the caller resolve any
ambiguities.

\todo{Use type constraints, not value constraints}

Allowing the overloading on constraints can also complicate method
overriding by introducing partial overrides.
Consider:
\begin{xtennoindent}
  class A {
    def m(x:int{self<=0}) = ...; // 1
    def m(x:int{self>=0}) = ...; // 2
  }
  class B {
    def m(x:int{self==0}) = ...; // 3
  }
\end{xtennoindent}
\noindent
\xcd"B.m"'s constraint on \xcd"x" partially overrides the
constraint on both \xcd"m" methods of \xcd"A".  Given a variable
\xcd"b" of type \xcd"B": \xcd"b.m(-1)" invokes \xcd"A.m" (method 1),
\xcd"b.m(0)" invokes \xcd"B.m" (method 3), and \xcd"b.m(1)"
invokes \xcd"A.m" (method 2).  Clients of \xcd"B" could get
confused about which method gets invoked.  One option is to
require that when a method with a given name is overridden, all
other methods with that name should be overridden as well.

Finally, one could support a form of predicate
dispatch~\cite{jpred}, selecting the method to invoke by
\emph{dynamically} evaluating the method guard. 
With type constraints and predicate dispatch, multi-method
dispatch can be implemented.  \todo{example}

\subsection{Implementation}

Finally, we turn to the implementation of generics.
To implement a generic class \xcd"C[X]" one can either generate a single 
class for \xcd"C" in the target language (homogeneous translation)
or generate one class per instantiation
\xcdmath"C[T$_1$]", \dots,
\xcdmath"C[T$_k$]" (heterogeneous translation).
The former approach reduces the amount of generated code; the
latter enables specialization based on the type arguments to
\xcd"C".  Hybrid approaches are possible as well.

Java's approach is to erase type parameters and to use the homogeneous
translation.  Erasure admits more dynamic errors because
it permits, for instance, a \xcd"C<A>" to be cast to \xcd"C<B>".
Retrieving a field of static type \xcd"B" could cause a run-time
type error when an \xcd"A" is returned instead.
The homogeneous translation is aided by a restriction that type
parameters cannot be instantiated on primitive types and by
using nominal subtyping bounds on types.
These restrictions ensure type parameters can be represented
with their type bound, or \xcd"Object" if unbounded.
Since, in \Xten, it should be possible to instantiate a generic
type on both value types and reference types, a homogeneous translation
must box value types so that both kinds of types have the same
representation.

PolyJ~\cite{java-popl97} supports structural bounds and uses a
homogeneous translation with adapter objects to allow generic
code to invoke methods on values of its type parameters.

Other languages, such as C++, use a heterogeneous
translation, specializing the generic class for each
instantiation.
C$\sharp$,
NextGen~\cite{nextgen}, and
Fortress~\cite{fortress} takes this approach as well, reducing
(static) code bloat by instantiating generic classes at run time.

A compromise approach is to specialize for only a few parameter
types, for example the primitive types, but to use a homogeneous
translation otherwise.

Representing type variables at run-time allows the language
to support run-time casts to generic types,
including possibly types instantiated on constrained types.

With
non-generic types, a cast such as
\xcd"r"~\xcd"as"~\xcd"Region{rank==k}" can be implemented by
checking the run-time class of the value being
cast---\xcd"r"~\xcd"instanceof"~\xcd"Region"---and then
evaluating the constraint---\xcd"r.rank==k".
%
However, the issue is more subtle with generic casts.
For instance, to do
\xcd"A"~\xcd"as"~\xcd"Array[int{self>=0}]"
one must check at run time that the concrete type used to instantiate
the \xcd"Array"'s type parameter is equivalent to
\xcd"int{self>=0}".  This check could involve a run-time
entailment check, 
breaking the phase distinction between
compile time and run time for constraint solving.

One approach is to restrict the language 
to rule out casts to type parameters 
and to generic types with subtyping constraints, ensuring that
entailment checks are not needed at run time.
Alternatively, 
the constraint solver could be embedded into the runtime system.
However, this
solution can result in inefficient run-time casts
if entailment checking for the given constraint system is expensive.
Finally, one can simply erase the constraints from the run-time
type information, preserving the base type.  As with Java's
erasure semantics, this approach is prone to run-time type
errors.

\subsection{X10 design decisions}

Given these considerations, the \Xten makes the following choices:
\begin{itemize}
\item \Xten supports subtyping and equality constraints on types
\item \Xten does not support structural bounds, but may do so in
the future.  \Xten has closures with structural subtyping, which
can be used in many of the cases structural type bounds would be
used.
\item Classes have type parameters with definition-site variance
rather than type properties with use-site variance annotations.
Properties are just too unfamiliar.
Usability outweighs expressive power. 
\item Run-time type information is preserved, but constraints
are not.  
\end{itemize}
