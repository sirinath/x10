\section{Visibility of Local Variables and Formals}

In general, variables (\ie, local variables, parameters,
properties, fields) are visible at
a point in the c
if they are defined before \xcd"T" in the program. This rule applies to
types in property lists as well as parameter lists (for methods and
constructors).
A formal parameter is visible in the types of all other formal
parameters of the same method, constructor, or type definition,
as well as in the method or constructor body itself.
Properties are accessible via their containing object--\xcd"this"
within the body of their class declaration.  The special
variable \xcd"this" is in scope at each property
declaration, constructor signatures and bodies, instance method signatures
and bodies,
and instance field signatures and initializers, but not in scope
at \xcd"static" method or field declarations or \xcd"static"
initializers.
