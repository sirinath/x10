\section{Future type constructor}
For any type {\tt t}, {\tt future<t>} is a type:
\begin{x10}
424   Type ::=   future < Type >  
\end{x10}
The type  represents a value which when forced will return a value of type
{\tt t}. Thus the type makes available the following methods:

\begin{x10}
  public Type force() {}
\end{x10}

%% Nothing to say about future/nullable yet.
