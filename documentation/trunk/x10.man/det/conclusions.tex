\subsubsection{Implementation}
An early version of this design was implemented in a branch of the X10
system. Results were obtained for about twenty benchmarks, including
JGF benchmarks such as IDEA, Sor, Series, RayTrace, LUFact,
SparseMatMul, Geometric Mean.  The speed of the programs written using
accumulators and clocked types was compared to the corresponding
programs written in plain X10. On the average we noticed about a 20\%
degradation in performance. 

A new implementation is currently being worked on and we expect to
have more up-to-date results for final submission. This implementation
rides piggyback on the control messages exchanged to implement
\code{finish} in order to update an \code{Acc} from multiple
places. The rules for reads on \code{Acc} guarantee that intermediate
accumulations can be stored at each place and do not need to be
communicated to the place where the \code{Acc} lives until local
computation has quiesced. 
This results in a very efficient implementation. 

\subsection{Adding static effects checking}

Safe X10 can be substantially enriched
through the addition of statically checked effects
\cite{Gifford:1986:IFI:319838.319848},\cite{DPJ}, particularly to
handle non-array-based computations. This section summarizes work
currently in progress \cite{effects-constrained-types}.

X10 already implements a very powerful dependent type system based on
constraints. An object \code{o} is of type \code{T\{c\}} if it is of
type \code{T} and further satisfies the constraint
\code{c[o/self]}. Thus \code{Array[T]\{self.rank==R\}} is the type of all
the arrays of \code{T} with rank \code{R}.

Types classify objects, i.e.{} types specify sets of
objects. Therefore we can define a {\em location set} to be of the form
\code{T.f} where \code{T} is a type and \code{f} is a mutable field of
type \code{T}. It stands for the set of locations \code{x.f} where
\code{x} is of type \code{T}. We do not need to introduce any distinct
notion of regions into the language.

The key insight is that two memory locations are distinct if they
either have different names or they have the same name \code{f} and
they live in two objects \code{m} and \code{n} such that for some
property \code{p}, \code{m.p != n.p} -- for then it must be the case
that \code{m != n}. Therefore we introduce enough properties into
classes to ensure that we can distinguish between objects that are
simultaneously being operated on. Specifically, the location sets
\code{S\{c\}.f} and \code{S\{d\}.f} are disjoint if
\code{c[x/self],d[x/self]} is not satisfiable for any \code{x:S}.

Methods are decorated with \code{@Read(L)} and \code{@Write(M)}
annotations, where \code{L},\code{M} are location sets. The annotation
is {\em valid} if every read (write) of a mutable location \code{o.f} in the
body of the method it is the case that \code{o.f} lies in (the set
described by) \code{L} (\code{M}).

We permit location sets to be named:
\begin{lstlisting}
  static locs Cargos = Tree.cargo;
  static locs LeftCargo(up:Tree) = Tree{self.up==up,self.left==true}.cargo;
\end{lstlisting}

Unlike the region system of \cite{DPJ} we do not need to introduce
explicitly named, intensional regions, rather we can work with
extensional representations of location sets (the set of all locations
satisfying a certain condition).  There is no need for a separate
space of region names with constructors. Two location sets are
disjoint if their constraints are mutually unsatisfiable, not because
they are named differently. In particular, we do not need to assume
that the heap is partitioned into a tree of regions.

Two key properties of the X10 type system are worth recalling. The run-time
heap cannot contain cycles involving only properties. This in turn
depends on the fact that the X10 type system prevents \code{this} from
escaping during object construction\cite{X10-object-initialization}.

We mark a property as \code{@ghost} to indicate that space is not
allocated at run-time for this property. Therefore the value of this
property is not accessible at run-time -- it cannot be read and stored
into variables. It may only be accessed in constraints that are
statically checked. Dynamic casts cannot refer to \code{@ghost}
properties.

We enrich the vocabulary of constraints. First, we permit
existentially quantified constraints \code{x:T\^c} -- this represents
the constraint \code{c} in which the variable \code{x} of type
\code{T} is existentially quantified. Second, we permit the {\em
  extended field selector} \code{e.f\$i} where \code{e} is an
expression, \code{f} a field name and \code{i} is a \code{UInt}.

%% Alternatively we just permit regular expressions as field
%% selectors?
%% So take T{self.r==x} where r is a regular expression to mean
%% T{p:??^(p in r, self.p==x)}. So we have to have a notion of a
%% type-consistent path, and then be able to select a path on a given
%% receiver, maybe use some other operator for this, and not .?


%% Hmm dont want to be able to count and do arithmetic, that will
%% take us out of reg exp land.

%% Do we need MONA?
%% May need to permit full-fledged regular expressions.

% Where do we need the flexibility of saying two region parameters are disjoint?

We use an example from \cite{DPJ} to illustrate:
  \begin{lstlisting}
type Tree(t:Tree,l:Boolean)=Tree{self.up==t,self.left==l};
class Tree (up:Tree, left:Boolean) {
    var left:Tree(this,true);
    var right:Tree(this,false);
    var payload:Int;
    //SubTree(t) is the type of all Trees o s.t.
    // for some UInt i, o.up...up=t (i-fold iteration).
    static type SubTree(t:Tree)=Tree{i:UInt^self.up$i==t};
    @safe
    def makeConstant(x:Int)
        @Write[SubTree(this)].payload
        @Read[SubTree(this)].(left,right) {
          finish {
            this.payload = x;
            if (left != null)
              async left.makeConstant(x);
            if (right != null)
              async right.makeConstant(x);
          }}}
  \end{lstlisting}
In this example the fields \code{left},\code{right} and \code{cargo}
are mutable. It is possible to mutate a tree \code{p} -- replace
\code{p}'s \code{left} child with another tree \code{q}. However, \code{q} cannot be in
\code{p}'s \code{right} subtree, because then its \code{up} field or
\code{left} field would not have the right value. That is, once a
\code{Tree} object is created it can only belong to a specific tree in
a specific position.

Note that a \code{Tree} can be created with \code{null} parent and
children. This is how the root is created:
\code{new Tree(null,true)} or \code{new tree(null, false)}.
%%
%%In checking the validity of the effect annotation on
%%\code{makeConstant} the compiler must check that the effects of the
%%body are contained in the declared effects of the method. This boils
%%down to checking the subtyping relations. e.g.{} for the \code{@Write} annotation it must check:
%%\begin{lstlisting}
%%SubTreeTree
%%Tree{i:UInt^(self.up$i.up==this,self.up$i.left==true} <: Tree{i:UInt^(self.up$i==this}
%%Tree{i:UInt^(self.up$i.up==this,self.up$i.left==false} <: Tree{i:UInt^(self.up$i==this}
%%Tree{self==this} <: Tree{i:UInt^(self.up$i==this)}
%%\end{lstlisting}

This is easily verified. 
%The notion of ``distinctions from the left''
%and ``distinctions from the right'' of \cite{DPJ} are not
%needed. These arise naturally through the use of constraints (distinct
%access paths, vs distinct fields).
Note that the programmer may not desire to have the fields \code{up}
and \code{left} be available at run-time. These fields can be marked
as \code{@ghost} -- any attempt to access them at run-time will result
in an error.
%Constraints such as ``this array must point to distinct objects'' can
%also be naturally represented in the dependent type system. 

\subsection{Conclusion}

This paper presents a lightweight design for a safe language which
permits very rich expression of concurrency idioms.
