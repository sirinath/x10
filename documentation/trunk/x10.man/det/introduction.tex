
Desiderata:

\begin{itemize}
\item Data-structures should by design by dynamically determinate and
   deadlock-free.
\item They should be first-class -- they can be stored in
  data-structures/read from them, passed as arguments to
  procedures/returned etc with no restrictions. 
\item Usable -- common idioms should be naturally and elegantly expressible.
\item Additional static type-checking can provide extra guarantees
  (e.g.{} no concurrency related run-time exceptions) that may aid
  efficient implementation.
\end{itemize}

We discuss three examples

  * clocks
  * accumulators
  * clocked types

Challenge
  Arbitrary nature of object graphs.


{\em 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Use activity registration as a mechanism to tame object graphs.
\item Focus on structured concurrency. Using scoping and block-structure
    to delimit regions of code that may execute in parallel and affect
    the data structure.

\item Accumulation can be defined safely by delaying. However, the delay
    operation is guaranteed to be deadlock-free.

\item Clocked types support phased computation, another common idiom
    particularly for stencil computations.
\end{enumerate}
}

Key contributions:
{\em 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Identification of determinate, deadlock-free data-structures. 
\item Discussion of design alternatives which points out the
  difficulty of integrating these ideas in a modern OO language.
\item Discussion of various idioms expressible using these data-structures.
\item Proof of determinacy and deadlock-freedom in an abstract version
  of the language.
\end{enumerate}
These constructs are implemented in \Xten, available as open source from
SVN head and will be in the next release of \Xten.
