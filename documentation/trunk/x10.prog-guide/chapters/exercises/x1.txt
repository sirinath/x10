Part 1: Write an X10 program which counts how many times sin(x*x) is greater
than zero, as x takes the values a, a+h, a+2h, ... a+nh.  Your program should
take a:Double, h:Double, and n:Int as command-line arguments.

Part 2: Now, do it in parallel, using all the Places available in the x10 run.

Part 3: Generalize it so that it lets you input a function -- written in X10,
as part of the main program, instead of sin(x*x).

Part 4: Now, get it to accept a function that's compiled separately, so you
can do the counting without having to recompile the main file.  You *will*
need to recompile the file containing the function.  You'll also have to
figure out how to get the function to the counter.
